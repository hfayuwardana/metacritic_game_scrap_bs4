Paradise was ruled with the hand of science, and the hand was that of the galactic governing body known as the Core. Ironically, it was the Core's ultimate victory, the victory over death itself, that brought about the downfall of its paradise and started the war that would decimate a million worlds. The immortality process, known as ""patterning,"" involved the electronic duplication of brain matrices, allowing the transfer of consciousness into durable machines. Effectively it meant immortality, and the Core decreed the process mandatory for all citizens in order to ensure their safety. However, there were many citizens unwilling to toss aside their bodies so casually, many indeed who regarded patterning as an atrocity. They fled to the outer edges of the galaxy, forming a resistance movement that became known as the Arm. War began, though it was never officially declared by either side. The Arm developed high-powered combat suits for its armies, while the Core transferred the minds of its soldiers directly into similarly deadly machines. The Core duplicated its finest warriors thousands of times over. The Arm countered with a massive cloning program.

Then at last you?ve found the game of your dreams. Take charge of a team; place 9 players in your half of the field, then go and put the ball in the opponent?s end-zone. Nothing easier! Except one small detail... there are a few opposition players determined to get the ball from you. On the pitch, as in the changing-rooms, there are no rules. Let yourself be carried away on the gentle airs of doping, corruption and hooliganism even before a match gets under way. Once on the pitch, if the ball doesn?t really interest you, then carry on destroying the opposition using all the underhand tricks at your disposal. If that doesn?t guarantee victory then magic and snares will come in useful. Even if massacring the opposition is encouraged, you?ll have to use far more subtle tactics to have a chance at winning. You?ll have to manage, as best you can, the individual talents of each of your players; take into account the mood of the spectators...to finally be able to get a few points on the scoreboard and make the opposition look foolish. It?s up to you whether you then comfort him or take advantage of him while he?s down to hit him with a few well chosen words. [Digital Jesters]",72,tbd,Real-Time

As players enter their humble town after finding their crown, they are assisted by their advisors, especially Howzer, in taking on missions in the immediate area of town. With the success of each, as well as activities like farming and natural resources development, they will gain wealth in the form of in-game currency called 'Bol.' Once an essential infrastructure has been established in town a suggestion box is set up through which in-game characters can make quest suggestions to supplement those of your advisors. During quests players in the role of young King Corobo can control multiple subjects of his kingdom who follow and serve based on your kingly status. These subjects have different professions which come in handy in specific as well as general quest scenarios and should be chosen wisely. Additional training facilities can be constructed to retrain existing subjects as well as those that are added to your kingdom as it prospers and eventually needs to expand into surrounding territories. The world of Little King's Story is expansive and set on many levels. Although each level contains multiple possible boss battles, progression through the game levels always requires the defeat of a substantial boss. Battles become more intense as you set out to conquer the lands that surround your kingdom, although these are never too overbearing due to the game's easy to alter difficulty settings. As these campaigns against neighboring kingdoms proceed you are kept aware of the health and happiness of your subjects at home and that of your troops via an information bar at the top left, as well as a ticker scrolling across the screen.

Fight for control over an entire planet in the campaign mode, where the storyline and missions develop according to your choices and achievements on the battlefield.

Tactics & Numbers
While the Arachnids can rely on virtually limitless numbers, the Mobile Infantry must develop effective tactics to overcome this imbalance. Deploy your units at strategic locations to cover vital choke points and gain superior firepower through tactical use of elevation levels. Be wary, however, that battle mechanics such as True Line of Sight and True Line of Fire also allow Bugs to lay ambushes around every corner, as they are well known for their use of surprise attacks and deception.

Units & Abilities
An expansive range of unique units, weapons, and special abilities are at the disposal of MI commanders. Infantry squads armed with Morita Assault Rifles and MX-90 Fragmentation Grenades form the mainstay of your forces. Rocket Troopers deliver deadly payloads with pin-point accuracy while Engineers are vital to shore up defensive positions with MG turrets, barricades, and minefields.
