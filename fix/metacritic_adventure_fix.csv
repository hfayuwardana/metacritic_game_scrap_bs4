It has been three years since Catherine de M√©dicis' rule as regent came to an end, but she still holds the reins of power, making her the target of repeated attacks from the French nobility. One day in March 1566, when she realises that she has fallen victim to a terrible curse, she turns to her doctor and astrologer, Michel de Nostre-Dame, better known as Nostradamus. Unfortunately, the famous prophet is too old and weak to take on such a mission alone. Refusing to abandon his queen in her hour of need, he sends his daughter Madeleine in his place. However, there is no such thing as women astrologers, let alone women doctors in medieval times. To be accepted as such, the young woman must go in disguise and assume her younger brother's identity, C√©sar, who is away for some time. Alternating between Madeleine the young woman and Madeleine disguised as C√©sar, players are plunged into a thriller where political scheming and ancestral prophecies are intertwined. The game begins as an initiatory adventure in the footsteps of her father, the prophet and astrologer, before creating all the suspense of a detective novel: from one murder to another, players make their way through a test-riddled forensic investigation.

From using your sharp analytical skills to solve a mystery, to putting your life on the line in an intense shoot-out, or shaking down the bad guy; a detective's life truly seems like life on the edge. Now, Hudson is set to give you a taste of that life with Miami Law, an all new adventure on Nintendo DS that has you saving the world with your fingertips! Miami Law is an action-adventure game packed with all of the ingredients of a prime-time TV show: an intricate storyline with a shadowy terrorist conspiracy, furious shoot-outs in abandoned warehouses, challenging crime-scene detective work and more.  Players will have many opportunities to choose their path and change the story - either as the intense Law Martin from the Miami PD or the brainy Sara Starling from the FBI. Players are presented with different challenges depending on which character they pick - playing as Sara features a puzzle-based element, whereas playing with Law thrusts the player into the action, often into car chases or shoot-outs where taking out the bad guys is the only way to get results.  Unlockable extras, including Texas Hold ‚ÄòEm Poker and Sudoku, are included to take the pressure off players when the tension gets thick. [Hudson Entertainment]",56,8.2,Adventure

No doubt you‚Äôve been waiting years for a half-decent game to show up in the Adventure category of the App Store. Well, this is it. Half-decent, as promised.

EPISODE 1: WE NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS
When a hostage crisis erupts in the centre of Clappers Wreake, only one man has the diplomatic finesse to defuse a simmering situation before it boils over into a stew of butchery and bloodshed: Detective Inspector Hector. He‚Äôs all they‚Äôve got. Literally. All the other negotiators are dead. Hector has a choice to make: carry out the terrorist‚Äôs curiously altruistic demands, or watch as his fellow officers are picked off one by one. Hector‚Äôs still on the fence.

Stagger a drunken mile through the Crime Capital of Britain in the size 9s of Detective Inspector Hector: part criminalist, part kebab-fiend, all cop.

Do all the things you‚Äôve dreamed about: hit a tramp with a crowbar, steal a young man‚Äôs trousers, kick a heroin addict into a cardboard box, enter a porn shop without embarrassment, carry a designer handbag... all in the name of justice, and all in spectacular ground-breaking 2D.

Did we mention? It‚Äôs not for kids.

This isn‚Äôt one of those bog-standard Oh-god-where-am-I-how-did-I-get-here-there‚Äôs-a-screwdriver-in-a-desk-drawer type escape games that the interweb seems to be infested with nowadays. HECTOR:BADGE OF CARNAGE takes you back to the glory days of the point 'n click graphic adventure: nonsensical inventory items, favour-hungry reprobates, and a relentless stream of witty one-liners. 

WHAT YOU GET:
 - 18 sordid, filthy, rundown locations
 - 23 well-developed & witty characters (+ 1 stinking drunk)
 - 40 Inventory items (includes Free Lubricant!) 
 - 397 interactive objects
 - 2421 spoken lines of dialogue
 - Cinematic cutscenes
 - Original score
 - A good few hours worth of low action puzzle-solving gameplay

WHAT WE GET:
 - Your cash.

Look, we honestly don‚Äôt care if you like it. We just want you to buy it. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll never see Episode 2 or 3.

IMPORTANT NOTE!

Riven for iOS is a VERY, VERY large application. We‚Äôve managed to optimized Riven from its original DVD size to a little over a gigabyte. Even at that size it‚Äôs one of the largest iOS app we know of - so PLEASE BE PATIENT - download times and syncing times can be longer! It's possible on slower iOS devices for the downloading/syncing to pause FOR 10  OR 15 MINUTES. 

Because of the large size it's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you download Riven on your computer using iTunes, and then sync with your iOS device. Downloading directly to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is theoretically possible via a wireless connection, but... uh... well... you really don‚Äôt want to.

Because of the way the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch install apps, you will need to have about 2 gigabytes of free space to install Riven. Once it's installed you can use the extra space again.",82,6.3,Adventure

The game world is based on the Norse Cosmology, with its mythological ‚Äúnine homeworlds‚Äù unified by the world tree Yggdrasill. Nevertheless, ‚ÄúVikings Can Fly!‚Äù doesn‚Äôt want to be a deadly dull serious game; that‚Äôs why the world is featured with engaging elements and fantastic locations.

STORY

In ‚ÄúVikings Can Fly!‚Äù you play as Bjorn, a young viking inventor with an incredible passion for women and a laboratory full of weird machineries. He actually never created something really useful to his people because he is always too busy running after young ladies. 
A few days ago he casually met a valkyrie that was bathing by a waterfall and he suddenly fell in love. She obviously ran away; leaving a sweet perfume trail along her path. His dream is to find her back all the way through the nine worlds of the Norse Gods. Will he be able to use his genius this time?

FLYING LOG AND ACHIEVEMENTS

The Viking sketches and describes all the places he discovers on the Flying Log, also taking notes of his achievements. 
There are 44 Achievements to unlock and each of them can provide the player some extra gold.

LABORATORY

The Viking can buy materials to produce new inventions with the gold earned during his flights. There are 12 items to unlock - from magical Runes to a Stone Giant to a crazy Steam Propeller and up to a Saddle for dragons taming! All of those together will allow the Viking to fly farther and farther.

To save his girlfriend, Toto sets out on an adventure in the Forest of Demons, where he meets all kinds of monsters. 

[Game Characteristics]

1. Transformation
: When Toto kills a monster, he absorbs a spirit that transforms him into a mighty werewolf during a full moon. This transformation lasts for a limited amount of time, during which Toto can kill monsters easily. As a werewolf, Toto‚Äôs health is not affected by attacks, and no monster can stand in his way. Enjoy the experience of this powerful transformation!

2. Item Cube
: Items with different functions are found in the Item Cubes in each stage. These items allow Toto to attack monsters with a weapon, attack from a distance, or become invisible. There are a lot more items, too, all of which can be viewed in the game.

3. Upgrade
: Toto‚Äôs werewolf skills can be upgraded so that he can continue to fight monsters, which become more powerful over time. When Toto‚Äôs speed is upgraded, he can run at incredible speeds for a dash attack. When his transformation time is upgraded, the duration of playing as a werewolf becomes longer. Toto‚Äôs many other skills can also be upgraded. What skills you choose to focus on are entirely up to you. Have fun!",67,tbd,Adventure

Enter a brilliant high definition world of revolution, mystery, and adventure as you pull together the clues and solve puzzles to uncover the sinister plot. The hero's ‚Äì Rex, the dog, and Mr. Moles - well of course - the mole, can't save Poco Pane without you.

City of Secrets is a classical point and click adventure game presented with beautiful hand drawn art, layered backgrounds and a 3D character cast, fully spoken throughout.

Over 1 million games sold. Rex and Mr. Moles have been on adventures across Europe for many years and are making their debut globally on iOS. We love to entertain and are confident that aideMMedia is one palindrome you will instantly love.

The game can be tougher than your college entrance exam and it isn‚Äôt clear yet if you will need help from your friends or some little kid to solve the sinister plot.

There are several methods in the game to point players in the right direction such as a notebook containing a list of completed and 'to-do' tasks - and a hint system giving a written clue for the next most important task if you really get stuck.

Better than an IQ test, challenge your friends to see who can solve the sinister plot first. Good luck!",72,tbd,Adventure

6th Planet tells the story of a near future, where the planet Saturn suddenly changes into a possible place for humans to live. To find out what is going on, a monkey is sent into space. This is the beginning of a series of events that will determine mankind‚Äôs future.

The goal of the game is to guide your space pod to the landing site on the other side of the level. With only two buttons to work with, it is a simple concept that‚Äôs easy to pick up, but hard to master. The Story Mode contains 50 levels, divided across 7 worlds. This stands for at least four hours of gameplay. If you succeed in finishing this mode, you unlock the Master levels, which is a collection of very challenging levels for you to try out. This mode will be updated in the future with more content.

The comic story, in between the levels, consists of a total of 188 screens, which is two comic books worth of images. The story is co-written and drawn by the studio that‚Äôs responsible for the Oscar nominated animation films The Triplets of Belleville and The Secret of Kells. Screens are colored by Raymund Lee, famous for his work on Marvel‚Äôs Wolverine series.

It was developed by a team of three students overseen by Dave Taylor (""Doom"", ""Quake"", ""Abuse"", ""Karateka"").  Art direction and overall game design was provided by John Chalfant, best known for his stunning characters in the WarCraft 3 trailers, his design work on Arthas (the ""Lich King"") for World of WarCraft, for his many collaborations with David Lynch, and most recently for the iconic key art used to promote ""Batman: Arkham City"".""Band Together is like Little Big Planet meets Lemmings...but with thumbtack death machines!  How cool is THAT?""  -- Duane Stinnett, Art Director on Starcraft and Diablo""As an aficionado of the cute and twisted, I love the art direction of Band Together.""  -- Lorne Lanning, Creative Director of the Oddworld Quintology""The characters are 'cuddly' but in a very sophisticated way, and the thumbtack 'nemesis' element is brilliant, not just clever. The shading, the overall ambience is thoroughly conducive in complimenting the overall 'story' base of creatures under threat. Kudos.""  -- Syd Mead, Designer""Countless times I've witnessed people get transfixed and mesmerized by Band Together (myself included).  I'm impressed that students were able to craft a game so engaging and addictive.""  -- Mike L. Murphy, Animator, Lord of the RingsThe Backstory:Michael Silverstein is nicknamed ""Midge"" by the mean kids in school because he has tiny, tiny hands.  Frustrated, Midge retreats to his Great Aunt's attic, where he makes things with his tiny hands that no one else can.While digging through the bowels of the attic, Midge finds an old, dusty shoebox.  Inside are curious little creatures fast asleep.  When exposed to the light, they all wake up and stare at Midge's tiny hands like they're the hands of God.Midge quickly takes a shine to the little creatures and decides to call them ""Bandies"" because they seem to like to band together.  While they don't say much, Midge eventually discovers that the Bandies are pining to be ""tested"", so he begins to build a series of diabolical tests to push the mysterious little Bandies to their limits!The Game:Welcome to ""Band Together: The Unboxing"" for the iPad 2 and new iPad.  Simply touch a Bandi, and drag him where you want to go.  Remember to keep all your Bandies well lit so they don't fall asleep, and steer clear of thumbtack death machines, pencil pit traps, baseball boulders, and more.  Figure out how to reach the popsicle stick pressure plates and miniature switches that open the trapdoors, retract the pencil walls, and move up the platforms that will get the bandies to the exit.  Part puzzle game, part adventure- all painfully cute fun for your iPad 2 and the new iPad!Game Features:  o Dozens of engaging levels with a gentle learning curve!  o Watch the story unfold in Midge's hand-drawn secret journal!  o Skip the levels that you aren't ready for and return to them later!  o See how many Bandies you can save on each level!  o Thoroughly tested on children aged 4 to 100!

You‚Äôve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they‚Äôre everywhere. Zombies. There‚Äôs only one thing you can do: Run!

Zombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. We deliver the story straight to your headphones through orders and voice recordings - and when you get back home, you use the supplies you‚Äôve collected while running to build and grow your base.

BBC NEWS - ‚ÄúThe only way to save yourself is to run for real.‚Äù
WIRED - ‚ÄúIn the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.‚Äù
WIRED UK - ‚ÄúPromises aerobic thrills and zombie kills aplenty.‚Äù
CNN - ‚ÄúTurns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.‚Äù
NPR - ""It gets you moving!""
TIME.COM - ""Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.""

WHAT PLAYERS SAY:
‚ÄúEvaded all zombie mobs :-) One of my best sprints ever; this app works!‚Äù
‚ÄúThis game will make you sweat. Perfect junction between game design and run tracker.‚Äù
‚ÄúJust tried @zombiesrungame and for the first time in my life I feel truly alive.‚Äù

WALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE
Zombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! 

YOU ARE RUNNER 5 
Hundreds of lives are counting on you. You've got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?

A WORLD OF STORIES
With 30 missions and over 40 runs worth of gameplay, you become the hero in an epic story of humanity‚Äôs struggle for survival where your running *really* matters - and there‚Äôs a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well...

YOUR OWN MIX
Choose your own custom playlists before you start running: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.

INTERVAL TRAINING - WITH ZOMBIES
With our optional ‚ÄòZombie Chases‚Äô mode, you‚Äôll need to increase your speed and work up a sweat if you hear zombies on your tail. That‚Äôs right - we‚Äôve made interval training *fun*!

KEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE
You automatically collect items like medicine, batteries, and ammo while running - but when you're back home, who needs them more: the soldiers or the doctors? Which buildings need extra defenses? It‚Äôs up to you - and the bigger your base, the more missions you can play.

NOTES
- The launch version comes with 13 missions, with 17 more missions to be released in upcoming free updates
- Requires iOS 5 or above. Works on iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, and iPod Touch 3rd gen and 4th gen.
- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
- Accelerometer mode requires you to keep your device unlocked while playing, which can dramatically decrease battery life.
- If you backed us on Kickstarter or pre-ordered via our shop, please download the ‚ÄúZR Advance‚Äù app instead.

COMING SOON
- Run logs
- Audio notifications of time and distance
- More Season 1 missions

Love is free. Flipflops, English leather and bandanas are the height of fashion. Meanwhile the Cold War is more than lukewarm and a real one is going on overseas. Movements are happening. Environmentalists, the female liberties movement, and on the dance floors an entirely different kind of movement is overtaking the underground clubs. The winds of change are certainly blowing over the country.Somewhere in the big city, in a tall, faceless government building someone left a window open. All the winds of change are doing here is blowing leaves all over Joe‚Äôs newly-swept floor. He‚Äôs been there for two years now. Working a dead-end attendant job making sure the building is as spotless as the suits walking the halls. It‚Äôs been like this for years, going from one soul-devouring job to the next.Our protagonist is Joe in more than just name. He is quite literally Joe Average. Average height, average weight, average IQ. In fact, the only thing remotely remarkable about him is exactly how much he conforms to the median of the hypothetical everyman, and up until this point, Joe‚Äôs life hasn‚Äôt exactly been biography material. This is all about to change.One morning while tending the floors, Joe is suddenly confronted by a mysterious dying man who is seemingly appearing out of nowhere. The man warns him that a terrible event is about to occur and pleads him to save mankind. As the man draws his last breath, he hands Joe a portable time travel device to aid him on his quest.It isn‚Äôt long before Joe activates the device and is confronted by the truth. The mysterious man was right: 40 years into the future mankind has become extinct. Stuck between a desolate future and a present where he is largely ignored, it is now up to our accidental hero to find out what has happened and how to prevent it in order to save mankind.",84,6.8,Adventure

And his newest adventure is even more fast-paced than ever before!

Several years after his last adventure with Dr. T, the hapless but incorrigible hero, Jack Keane returns to experience the greatest adventure of his life alongside the beautiful Amanda. However he soon realises once again that nothing goes quite as smoothly as Jack had imagined.

Shanghai, 1899 -The mysterious Chinese city is the epicentre for adventurers of all kinds. Jack Keane, too, has been attracted to the place by rumours of a legendary treasure - or to be more precise, these tales have led him right inside the walls of the notorious Shanghai prison. It is within these walls that the guardian of the treasure, a secretive shaman, has been locked up for years. Unfortunately for our hero, Jack has completely disregarded the fact that it is a lot easier to get INTO prison than out of it

And this is only the beginning of Jack Keane's newest bizarre adventure: mysterious treasures, ruthless villains, two distractingly beautiful women and tons of clever humour await the most lovable treasure hunter to have ever sailed the seven seas in a comical tour de force around the globe. During his travels, Jack will not only meet old friends, but also encounter new faces such as the elegant city-lady Eve and the brilliant German engineer Carl.

Jack Keane 2 - The Fire Within is set to revolutionise the classic point & click adventure genre. Never has an adventure been as cinematic, fast-paced and humorous, without breaking any of the iconic point & click gameplay rules.

State of the art 3D-graphics, gripping action-sequences and the typical bizarre Jack Keanesque humour will be an absolute delight to all adventure fans.

It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you wont be able to see them.

You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethans home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.

Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.

Still, the discoveries wont happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Pauls supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.

Key Features:

*    Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley, which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments.
*    Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues that help you piece together the truth behind Ethans disappearance -- and the fate of his family.
*    Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction, all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft.
*    Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace. Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease.",77,8.3,Adventure

This game depicts the maiden adventure of a woman named Shelia in the year 2020.

The 1000-year-old relic swords known as ""Kanshou and Bakuya"", discovered through SRO research, have been found to comprise a unique multilayered structure, containing a mysterious substance in their cores. This substance, known as the ""Soul of Jiu Xuan"", possesses the ability to reanimate the dead. In an attempt to take possession of the substance, the ""SAI"" - a massive terrorist organization controlling its own army - has used a cutting-edge piece of technology known as a ""Quantum Transporter"" to infiltrate the SRO research facility and steal top-secret and incredibly dangerous data. To make matters worse, while attempting to calibrate coordinates on the Quantum Transporter, Shelia mistakenly activates the device, immediately transporting everyone in the vicinity to the Floating Island - an airborne continent near the North Pole, undisturbed in its slumber for over 1000 years. It is soon discovered that the various beasts and corpses of those who once populated the island have been reanimated by the ""Soul of Jiu Xuan"", and they're coming for Shelia...

In the world of Alestia, the sheltered forest village of Valinorth exists largely independent from every other nation, never taking sides in political conflict and remaining non-partisan.

CHARACTERS:

JURO KURABE
A mild-mannered young high school student trying to live a normal life in the 80s. Rarely excited, he is fond of campy old Sci-Fi movies, with their giant robots and space invasions. But it seems like everyone in his life is trying to manipulate him for their own ominous ends...

IORI FUYUSAKA
She believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call? 

EI SEKIGAHARA 
A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past. Declared a boy ""from another dimension"", he's constantly pursued by armed gunmen in black suits, and often finds himself in intense life-or-death situations. Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... 

KEITARO MIURA 
A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a ""Sentinel"", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II... 

MEGUMI YAKUSHIJI
A shy, composed girl of few words, with a nurturing domestic side. While she's devoted to her beloved, Juro, he himself has lost all memory of their past relationship. Goaded on by a mysterious talking cat, she agrees to a ""contract"" -- willing to go to any length to restore the boy she loves. 

NATSUNO MINAMI 
A perky, friendly girl on her high school's track team who loves a good Sci-Fi story. When she discovers a small robot hiding in the school, it seems like a story out of one of her favorite movies. However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real. 

NENJI OGATA
A high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head. Still, he's determined to bust through and save the girl -- even if he's resigned to her thinking he's just another thug. 

RENYA GOUTO
A cold, brilliant young man who will use any means necessary to find the truth. Gouto processes information and startling revelations with a calm, ready intelligence that baffles (or outpaces) the adults around him. He's no villain, but he knows what's at stake, and what must be done. 

RYOKO SHININOME 
An aloof agent desperate to prove her worth to her unrequited love (and mentor) Tetsuya Ida. A mission gone wrong left Ryoko with traumatic brain damage, and dependent on a medicine of unclear origins. Still, she fights through the mental fog and pain to untangle the conspiracies... 

SHU AMIGUCHI 
An easygoing late-80s high school playboy, quick to make friends and quick to flirt. Tries not to take life too seriously, whether it's on his side or not. But when his TV turns on by itself, and an idol starts talking to him through it, begging for his help unraveling a mystery...he rolls with it as best he can. 

TAKATOSHI HIJIYAMA
A confident young Japanese soldier in the 1940s, displaced from his home and dropped into a city both foreign and familiar. Adrift, old-fashioned, and out of place, he struggles to make sense of all the changes in his world...and then, after months of living as a solitary vagrant, he finds the young man responsible for uprooting his life. 

TOMI KISARAGI
A flippant, shy teenager. She often hangs out with her gal pals after school, getting snacks and chatting like any other, but she seems to know more than she lets on. Determined to investigate the mysteries of her fate, she surreptitiously follows whatever lead she can, only to discover even greater peril awaiting her...

YUKI TAKAMIYA 
A surly delinquent who (reluctantly) infiltrates the school as a spy to save her best friend. Despite her disdain for her underhanded allies, she stubbornly seeks the truth when everyone else has something to hide. Tough and caustic, but she's got a protective streak and a sharp mind.",88,8.8,Adventure

Tokyo has become a city under siege; overwhelmed by paranormal threats beyond our understanding. After a devastating occult event leads to the disappearance of 99% of the city's population, only you stand between the loss of this great city and its salvation. After the vanishing, a strange encounter causes your own supernatural abilities to take shape.

* Amewarashi: This entity manifests as a young child in a yellow raincoat. Derived from the powerful emotions of sadness caused by being separated from his parents, as well as his innocent yet mischievous spirit, this Visitor will call for help and bring forth fellow spirit when it feels threatened. 
* Shiromuku: Shiromuku is a traditional type of pure white wedding kimono, and though she may appear to be a bride, this Visitor is actually a physical manifestation of powerful emotions. This Visitor represents regret and strong feelings for a partner she was never able to marry. 
* Kuchisake: Inspired by an actual urban legend, the Kuchisake-onna is a strong and agile opponent, capable of closing distances quickly to get at you with her large scissor blades. Be careful if she asks you if you find her attractive; there are no right answers there.
