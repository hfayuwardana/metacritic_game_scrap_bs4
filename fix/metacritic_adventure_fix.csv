It has been three years since Catherine de Médicis' rule as regent came to an end, but she still holds the reins of power, making her the target of repeated attacks from the French nobility. One day in March 1566, when she realises that she has fallen victim to a terrible curse, she turns to her doctor and astrologer, Michel de Nostre-Dame, better known as Nostradamus. Unfortunately, the famous prophet is too old and weak to take on such a mission alone. Refusing to abandon his queen in her hour of need, he sends his daughter Madeleine in his place. However, there is no such thing as women astrologers, let alone women doctors in medieval times. To be accepted as such, the young woman must go in disguise and assume her younger brother's identity, César, who is away for some time. Alternating between Madeleine the young woman and Madeleine disguised as César, players are plunged into a thriller where political scheming and ancestral prophecies are intertwined. The game begins as an initiatory adventure in the footsteps of her father, the prophet and astrologer, before creating all the suspense of a detective novel: from one murder to another, players make their way through a test-riddled forensic investigation.

No doubt you’ve been waiting years for a half-decent game to show up in the Adventure category of the App Store. Well, this is it. Half-decent, as promised.

EPISODE 1: WE NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS
When a hostage crisis erupts in the centre of Clappers Wreake, only one man has the diplomatic finesse to defuse a simmering situation before it boils over into a stew of butchery and bloodshed: Detective Inspector Hector. He’s all they’ve got. Literally. All the other negotiators are dead. Hector has a choice to make: carry out the terrorist’s curiously altruistic demands, or watch as his fellow officers are picked off one by one. Hector’s still on the fence.

Stagger a drunken mile through the Crime Capital of Britain in the size 9s of Detective Inspector Hector: part criminalist, part kebab-fiend, all cop.

Do all the things you’ve dreamed about: hit a tramp with a crowbar, steal a young man’s trousers, kick a heroin addict into a cardboard box, enter a porn shop without embarrassment, carry a designer handbag... all in the name of justice, and all in spectacular ground-breaking 2D.

Did we mention? It’s not for kids.

This isn’t one of those bog-standard Oh-god-where-am-I-how-did-I-get-here-there’s-a-screwdriver-in-a-desk-drawer type escape games that the interweb seems to be infested with nowadays. HECTOR:BADGE OF CARNAGE takes you back to the glory days of the point 'n click graphic adventure: nonsensical inventory items, favour-hungry reprobates, and a relentless stream of witty one-liners. 

WHAT YOU GET:
 - 18 sordid, filthy, rundown locations
 - 23 well-developed & witty characters (+ 1 stinking drunk)
 - 40 Inventory items (includes Free Lubricant!) 
 - 397 interactive objects
 - 2421 spoken lines of dialogue
 - Cinematic cutscenes
 - Original score
 - A good few hours worth of low action puzzle-solving gameplay

WHAT WE GET:
 - Your cash.

Look, we honestly don’t care if you like it. We just want you to buy it. If you don’t, you’ll never see Episode 2 or 3.

While mastering these abilities -- future sight, teleportation, shape shifting, mind reading -- and investigating their ancient source, Freelance Police Sam & Max must fend off Skunk’ape and get him banished to The Penal Zone.

You’re the piñata for a host of partying monsters. They probably look a lot worse than they sound. You should count yourself lucky it’s too dark to see them.

Your eyes are useless to you here — but your ears are filled with sound. And what is it you can hear … ? All you know is the soul of someone you love is in grave danger and desperately needs your help. Can you save them and make your escape or will you be trapped in the blackness forever?

Papa Sangre is a true breakthrough in mobile games, created by an amazing team of designers and technologists in California and London.

IMPORTANT NOTE!

Riven for iOS is a VERY, VERY large application. We’ve managed to optimized Riven from its original DVD size to a little over a gigabyte. Even at that size it’s one of the largest iOS app we know of - so PLEASE BE PATIENT - download times and syncing times can be longer! It's possible on slower iOS devices for the downloading/syncing to pause FOR 10  OR 15 MINUTES. 

Because of the large size it's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you download Riven on your computer using iTunes, and then sync with your iOS device. Downloading directly to your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is theoretically possible via a wireless connection, but... uh... well... you really don’t want to.

Because of the way the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch install apps, you will need to have about 2 gigabytes of free space to install Riven. Once it's installed you can use the extra space again.",82,6.3,Adventure

THE GAME WORLD

The game world is based on the Norse Cosmology, with its mythological “nine homeworlds” unified by the world tree Yggdrasill. Nevertheless, “Vikings Can Fly!” doesn’t want to be a deadly dull serious game; that’s why the world is featured with engaging elements and fantastic locations.

MYTH AND MORE...

The main world feature is the mix of mythological and fantasy elements. The Viking will use his crafts to discover 11 legendary and dreamy places.

STORY

In “Vikings Can Fly!” you play as Bjorn, a young viking inventor with an incredible passion for women and a laboratory full of weird machineries. He actually never created something really useful to his people because he is always too busy running after young ladies. 
A few days ago he casually met a valkyrie that was bathing by a waterfall and he suddenly fell in love. She obviously ran away; leaving a sweet perfume trail along her path. His dream is to find her back all the way through the nine worlds of the Norse Gods. Will he be able to use his genius this time?

FLYING LOG AND ACHIEVEMENTS

The Viking sketches and describes all the places he discovers on the Flying Log, also taking notes of his achievements. 
There are 44 Achievements to unlock and each of them can provide the player some extra gold.

LABORATORY

The Viking can buy materials to produce new inventions with the gold earned during his flights. There are 12 items to unlock - from magical Runes to a Stone Giant to a crazy Steam Propeller and up to a Saddle for dragons taming!

While the original got rave reviews for its stylized manga graphics and quick, bloody gameplay, Samurai II delivers even more action and an intuitive new control scheme.

Samurai: Way of the Warrior was featured in Best Games of 2009 by Apple – Samurai II is a true successor, aided by over a year of focused development. Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers. Screenshots don’t do Samurai II justice – the fluid action has to be seen running at 60 frames per second on the Retina display or popping off the iPad screen.

But looks alone won’t carry a game – the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new experience for hack ‘n’ slash gamers on the go. 

Samurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he get his Vengeance?

FEATURES:

? Universal app - supports iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod Touch 3G, and iPad. The game is optimized to take advantage of each device's strengths.

? Intuitive virtual joystick ensures you’re slicing up baddies, not swiping the screen.

? Dynamic camera finds the best perspective for each encounter, adding variety while keeping focused on the action.

? Tense, quick and gory battle sequences!
- Battle hordes of on-screen enemies wielding new weapons and sporting unique abilities.
- Stay nimble and plan your attacks – roll out of harm’s way and eliminate ranged enemies like the Samurai Archer before they can strike.
? Improved gameplay includes new features.
-   Solve environmental puzzles, avoid dangerous traps, and discover useful items.
- The fight is on - not to worry, the combat never takes a back seat to platforming or fetch-quests.

? RPG elements reward skilled players – upgrade the Samurai’s health, buy new attack combos and upgrade them to devastating levels.

? Between levels, gorgeous anime-style comic panels tell the samurai’s tale with original hand-drawn artwork.

? New survival mode pits the samurai against waves of enemies, giving hardcore players a score-attack mode to hone their skills. Two games in one!

? Runs at 60 frames per second on iPhone 4G, iPod 4G and iPad.

? Advanced AI system on par with console games. Goal Oriented Action Planning architecture is used in many PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 games.

? Samurai II is developed on the Unity 3D 3.0 engine, the latest technology available on mobile devices.

? Apple Game Center support, including Leaderboards and Achievements.

? Original soundtrack – in classic samurai movie style, soft music builds with the heat of battle.

A Puzzling Adventure with a Twist

When White House inquiries to the Scoggins Eraser Co. are answered only with curious puzzles, Nelson Tethers from the U.S. Department of Puzzle Research is sent on the case.

He soon realizes that these - along with the clinically pre-occupied townspeople, secret societies, and peculiar sounds from the forest - are intimately connected to the core mystery. And what's with the gnomes?

* Plentiful puzzles to challenge your neurons. See if you can find every puzzle to solve the mystery of Scoggins -- mazes, logic, riddles, brainteasers and more. 

* Investigate the strange, peculiar and mind-boggling to crack the case! Your discoveries provide clues to the larger mystery crippling the town, or uncover puzzles that must be solved to reveal answers ... or even more questions. 

* Hunting for Hints: Chewing gum helps Agent Tethers think and solve. Find and collect gum wads around the town to uncover hints if you get ""stuck"" in any puzzles.

 ‘Transform with the Full Moon!’

Wolf Boy is an exciting game with simple controls, fast action, and powerful transformations. 

The world where humans and monsters coexist…
Monk, a giant monkey, has failed in his many attempts to conquer the world, each time because of the werewolf, Toto. In order to eliminate Toto, Monk kidnaps Rucy, Toto’s human girlfriend, and takes her to his castle beyond the Forest of Demons.
To save his girlfriend, Toto sets out on an adventure in the Forest of Demons, where he meets all kinds of monsters. 

[Game Characteristics]

1. Transformation
: When Toto kills a monster, he absorbs a spirit that transforms him into a mighty werewolf during a full moon. This transformation lasts for a limited amount of time, during which Toto can kill monsters easily. As a werewolf, Toto’s health is not affected by attacks, and no monster can stand in his way. Enjoy the experience of this powerful transformation!

2. Item Cube
: Items with different functions are found in the Item Cubes in each stage. These items allow Toto to attack monsters with a weapon, attack from a distance, or become invisible. There are a lot more items, too, all of which can be viewed in the game.

3. Upgrade
: Toto’s werewolf skills can be upgraded so that he can continue to fight monsters, which become more powerful over time. When Toto’s speed is upgraded, he can run at incredible speeds for a dash attack. When his transformation time is upgraded, the duration of playing as a werewolf becomes longer. Toto’s many other skills can also be upgraded. What skills you choose to focus on are entirely up to you. Have fun!",67,tbd,Adventure

FRENCH, SPANISH AND GERMAN LANGUAGE VERSION COMING SOON!

6th Planet tells the story of a near future, where the planet Saturn suddenly changes into a possible place for humans to live. To find out what is going on, a monkey is sent into space. This is the beginning of a series of events that will determine mankind’s future.

The goal of the game is to guide your space pod to the landing site on the other side of the level. With only two buttons to work with, it is a simple concept that’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. The Story Mode contains 50 levels, divided across 7 worlds. This stands for at least four hours of gameplay. If you succeed in finishing this mode, you unlock the Master levels, which is a collection of very challenging levels for you to try out. This mode will be updated in the future with more content.

The comic story, in between the levels, consists of a total of 188 screens, which is two comic books worth of images. The story is co-written and drawn by the studio that’s responsible for the Oscar nominated animation films The Triplets of Belleville and The Secret of Kells. Screens are colored by Raymund Lee, famous for his work on Marvel’s Wolverine series.

Club“...Aquaria, if you give it time to boil, starts to feel like the first 10 minutes of Pan’s Labyrinth – a dark fairy tale taking place underneath our feet.”—Scott Colbourne, The Globe and Mail“From a design standpoint Aquaria is a triumph. Puzzles and boss fights are just the right complexity and the level design is spot on... From the control scheme to the visual design the game just feels ‘right’ as though all elements are working in harmony.”—Nathan Cocks, PC Power Play“All in all, Aquaria is damned good. If you’re at all a fan of 2D adventures – and if you aren’t, what the hell is wrong with you – you’ll find something appealing in its labyrinth of caverns and corals. It feels retro, but totally new; classic, yet fresh.”—Reverend Anthony, DestructoidWill you journey to the land beyond the surface and brave the dark sinister waters below? Will you defeat the ancient beings of Aquaria or fall prey to them? Will you find a companion or wander the waters of Aquaria alone?",84,tbd,Adventure

You’ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they’re everywhere. Zombies. There’s only one thing you can do: Run!

Zombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. We deliver the story straight to your headphones through orders and voice recordings - and when you get back home, you use the supplies you’ve collected while running to build and grow your base.

BBC NEWS - “The only way to save yourself is to run for real.”
WIRED - “In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.”
WIRED UK - “Promises aerobic thrills and zombie kills aplenty.”
CNN - “Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.”
NPR - ""It gets you moving!""
TIME.COM - ""Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.""

WHAT PLAYERS SAY:
“Evaded all zombie mobs :-) One of my best sprints ever; this app works!”
“This game will make you sweat. Perfect junction between game design and run tracker.”
“Just tried @zombiesrungame and for the first time in my life I feel truly alive.”

WALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE
Zombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! 

YOU ARE RUNNER 5 
Hundreds of lives are counting on you. You've got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?

A WORLD OF STORIES
With 30 missions and over 40 runs worth of gameplay, you become the hero in an epic story of humanity’s struggle for survival where your running *really* matters - and there’s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well...

YOUR OWN MIX
Choose your own custom playlists before you start running: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.

INTERVAL TRAINING - WITH ZOMBIES
With our optional ‘Zombie Chases’ mode, you’ll need to increase your speed and work up a sweat if you hear zombies on your tail. That’s right - we’ve made interval training *fun*!

KEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE
You automatically collect items like medicine, batteries, and ammo while running - but when you're back home, who needs them more: the soldiers or the doctors? Which buildings need extra defenses? It’s up to you - and the bigger your base, the more missions you can play.

NOTES
- The launch version comes with 13 missions, with 17 more missions to be released in upcoming free updates
- Requires iOS 5 or above. Works on iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, and iPod Touch 3rd gen and 4th gen.
- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.
- Accelerometer mode requires you to keep your device unlocked while playing, which can dramatically decrease battery life.
- If you backed us on Kickstarter or pre-ordered via our shop, please download the “ZR Advance” app instead.

COMING SOON
- Run logs
- Audio notifications of time and distance
- More Season 1 missions
- Much, much more!

Average height, average weight, average IQ. In fact, the only thing remotely remarkable about him is exactly how much he conforms to the median of the hypothetical everyman, and up until this point, Joe’s life hasn’t exactly been biography material. This is all about to change.One morning while tending the floors, Joe is suddenly confronted by a mysterious dying man who is seemingly appearing out of nowhere. The man warns him that a terrible event is about to occur and pleads him to save mankind.

And his newest adventure is even more fast-paced than ever before!

Several years after his last adventure with Dr. T, the hapless but incorrigible hero, Jack Keane returns to experience the greatest adventure of his life alongside the beautiful Amanda. However he soon realises once again that nothing goes quite as smoothly as Jack had imagined.

Shanghai, 1899 -The mysterious Chinese city is the epicentre for adventurers of all kinds. Jack Keane, too, has been attracted to the place by rumours of a legendary treasure - or to be more precise, these tales have led him right inside the walls of the notorious Shanghai prison. It is within these walls that the guardian of the treasure, a secretive shaman, has been locked up for years. Unfortunately for our hero, Jack has completely disregarded the fact that it is a lot easier to get INTO prison than out of it

And this is only the beginning of Jack Keane's newest bizarre adventure: mysterious treasures, ruthless villains, two distractingly beautiful women and tons of clever humour await the most lovable treasure hunter to have ever sailed the seven seas in a comical tour de force around the globe. During his travels, Jack will not only meet old friends, but also encounter new faces such as the elegant city-lady Eve and the brilliant German engineer Carl.

Jack Keane 2 - The Fire Within is set to revolutionise the classic point & click adventure genre. Never has an adventure been as cinematic, fast-paced and humorous, without breaking any of the iconic point & click gameplay rules.

State of the art 3D-graphics, gripping action-sequences and the typical bizarre Jack Keanesque humour will be an absolute delight to all adventure fans.

Features

- Control your characters directly with WASD, or switch to the classic Point & Click-Style

Business is as usual in the isolated research city of Rokumei–that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the nuclear research facility known as “LABO.” The city sends in “Sirius,” an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.

The story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels, Root Double does not have clear cut “choices,” but rather, the game uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion. Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system and completion of both protagonists’ stories can the player piece together the truth and hope to discover a way out of the facility.",75,7.9,Adventure

It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you wont be able to see them.

You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethans home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.

Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters.

Still, the discoveries wont happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Pauls supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy.

Key Features:

*    Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley, which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments.
*    Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues that help you piece together the truth behind Ethans disappearance -- and the fate of his family.
*    Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction, all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft.
*    Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace. Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease.",77,8.3,Adventure

Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem.

Together, they’re the Freelance Police. And they’re about to save the world.

In 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam & Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within.

Now everyone’s favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in Sam & Max Save the World Remastered, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam & Max creator Steve Purcell.

It’s just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the “spinny thing” they do with their eyes.)

Who’s the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam’s nose for detective work, Max’s lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam & Max’s street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.

Return to the adventure game that was once called “gaming’s first sitcom” and is today known as “the remaster you didn’t know you were waiting for.” With enhanced graphics, Joy-Con™ and touch screen support, an original jazz score with five new tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN’s Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, Sam & Max Save the World Remastered is a modern classic that will be right at home in your Nintendo Switch™ library.",75,4.9,Adventure

Business is as usual in the isolated research city of Rokumei–that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the nuclear research facility known as “LABO.” The city sends in “Sirius,” an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.

The story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels, Root Double does not have clear cut “choices,” but rather, the game uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion. Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system and completion of both protagonists’ stories can the player piece together the truth and hope to discover a way out of the facility.",78,tbd,Adventure

Combine a wide variety of skills and abilities to unleash dazzling combo attacks. SRO (Supernatural Science Research Organization) agent Shelia's adventure is about to begin.

This game depicts the maiden adventure of a woman named Shelia in the year 2020.

The 1000-year-old relic swords known as ""Kanshou and Bakuya"", discovered through SRO research, have been found to comprise a unique multilayered structure, containing a mysterious substance in their cores. This substance, known as the ""Soul of Jiu Xuan"", possesses the ability to reanimate the dead. In an attempt to take possession of the substance, the ""SAI"" - a massive terrorist organization controlling its own army - has used a cutting-edge piece of technology known as a ""Quantum Transporter"" to infiltrate the SRO research facility and steal top-secret and incredibly dangerous data. To make matters worse, while attempting to calibrate coordinates on the Quantum Transporter, Shelia mistakenly activates the device, immediately transporting everyone in the vicinity to the Floating Island - an airborne continent near the North Pole, undisturbed in its slumber for over 1000 years. It is soon discovered that the various beasts and corpses of those who once populated the island have been reanimated by the ""Soul of Jiu Xuan"", and they're coming for Shelia...

In the world of Alestia, the sheltered forest village of Valinorth exists largely independent from every other nation, never taking sides in political conflict and remaining non-partisan.

CHARACTERS:

JURO KURABE
A mild-mannered young high school student trying to live a normal life in the 80s. Rarely excited, he is fond of campy old Sci-Fi movies, with their giant robots and space invasions. But it seems like everyone in his life is trying to manipulate him for their own ominous ends...

IORI FUYUSAKA
She believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call? 

EI SEKIGAHARA 
A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past. Declared a boy ""from another dimension"", he's constantly pursued by armed gunmen in black suits, and often finds himself in intense life-or-death situations. Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... 

KEITARO MIURA 
A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a ""Sentinel"", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II... 

MEGUMI YAKUSHIJI
A shy, composed girl of few words, with a nurturing domestic side. While she's devoted to her beloved, Juro, he himself has lost all memory of their past relationship. Goaded on by a mysterious talking cat, she agrees to a ""contract"" -- willing to go to any length to restore the boy she loves. 

NATSUNO MINAMI 
A perky, friendly girl on her high school's track team who loves a good Sci-Fi story. When she discovers a small robot hiding in the school, it seems like a story out of one of her favorite movies. However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real. 

NENJI OGATA
A high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head. Still, he's determined to bust through and save the girl -- even if he's resigned to her thinking he's just another thug. 

RENYA GOUTO
A cold, brilliant young man who will use any means necessary to find the truth. Gouto processes information and startling revelations with a calm, ready intelligence that baffles (or outpaces) the adults around him. He's no villain, but he knows what's at stake, and what must be done. 

RYOKO SHININOME 
An aloof agent desperate to prove her worth to her unrequited love (and mentor) Tetsuya Ida. A mission gone wrong left Ryoko with traumatic brain damage, and dependent on a medicine of unclear origins. Still, she fights through the mental fog and pain to untangle the conspiracies... 

SHU AMIGUCHI 
An easygoing late-80s high school playboy, quick to make friends and quick to flirt. Tries not to take life too seriously, whether it's on his side or not. But when his TV turns on by itself, and an idol starts talking to him through it, begging for his help unraveling a mystery...he rolls with it as best he can. 

TAKATOSHI HIJIYAMA
A confident young Japanese soldier in the 1940s, displaced from his home and dropped into a city both foreign and familiar. Adrift, old-fashioned, and out of place, he struggles to make sense of all the changes in his world...and then, after months of living as a solitary vagrant, he finds the young man responsible for uprooting his life. 

TOMI KISARAGI
A flippant, shy teenager. She often hangs out with her gal pals after school, getting snacks and chatting like any other, but she seems to know more than she lets on. Determined to investigate the mysteries of her fate, she surreptitiously follows whatever lead she can, only to discover even greater peril awaiting her...

YUKI TAKAMIYA 
A surly delinquent who (reluctantly) infiltrates the school as a spy to save her best friend. Despite her disdain for her underhanded allies, she stubbornly seeks the truth when everyone else has something to hide.

Tokyo has become a city under siege; overwhelmed by paranormal threats beyond our understanding. After a devastating occult event leads to the disappearance of 99% of the city's population, only you stand between the loss of this great city and its salvation.

* Amewarashi: This entity manifests as a young child in a yellow raincoat. Derived from the powerful emotions of sadness caused by being separated from his parents, as well as his innocent yet mischievous spirit, this Visitor will call for help and bring forth fellow spirit when it feels threatened. 
* Shiromuku: Shiromuku is a traditional type of pure white wedding kimono, and though she may appear to be a bride, this Visitor is actually a physical manifestation of powerful emotions. This Visitor represents regret and strong feelings for a partner she was never able to marry. 
* Kuchisake: Inspired by an actual urban legend, the Kuchisake-onna is a strong and agile opponent, capable of closing distances quickly to get at you with her large scissor blades. Be careful if she asks you if you find her attractive; there are no right answers there.
