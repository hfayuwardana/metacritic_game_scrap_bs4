The move gives Triple Play another leap in realism, from the ultra-sharp graphics with real player faces and stadiums to the advanced AI that enables more realistic and flexible gameplay. The DUALSHOCK 2 controller's analog features are now a key element of the batting, pitching, and fielding control for a truer sports gaming experience. To get the game right, EA once again turned to the pros--American League MVP Jason Giambi of the Oakland A's and National League Manager of the Year Dusty Baker of the S.F. Giants lent their expertise on how to play hardball in the majors. Of course, in baseball, what it all boils down to is the showdown at the plate--the pitcher facing off against the batter for all the money. Triple Play Baseball again refines the game with a power zone/contact zone batting cursor--power hitters may have a tiny cursor, but it's all power zone, while more dependable sluggers will have a larger cursor but may have a smaller sweet spot. Batters are going to need all that control if they're hoping to tee off the pitching this year, which is also improved in control to give them every trick in the books. Players' skills are accurately based on player stats from last season, so if you see Mark McGwire at the plate or Randy Johnson on the mound, expect some bad things to go down.",74,tbd,Sports

It is the RPG quality that makes Shot-Online the unique game it is, especially with the community interaction and the enhancement and leveling of your character. Speaking of community and role-playing, Shot-Online offers both realistic and rare items drawn from the celebrated history of golf. Practicing every day, competing against players with different skills, allows the gamer to advance their characters abilities. Quests and item exchanging and more add to the community feel. A proprietary physics engine was used in Shot-Online to accurately recreate the ball and course dynamics. In other words, the ball will behave as it should over the geography of the course. Characters also benefit from accuracy through technology. Motion captured golf swings from a PGA golfer were used to match the most spot-on feel of a real golf swing, putting, chip shot, and other golfing actions. As a gallery, watching a game played on Shot-Online is like seeing a professional golf sportscast on television, with the overall presentation, the numerous camera angles and the gallery mode.

Millennia have since passed, and the temples now lie in ruins. But their energy still resonates from the land, attracting adventurers from distant lands. Drawn by the unknown force, friends have begun to rebuild the ruins into ball courts, knowing only that they must relive the time-honored test of the spirit of the Elders: the game now known as basketball. HoopWorld is a three-on-three basketball game with an arcade twist. Unique characters and beautiful natural locations set the stage, while fighting and random power-ups keep the game fast and rough.

""Overall Carnivores is unbelievably deep and features unlimited replay value. Every hunt is different, there’s tons of strategy involved and it’s really an iDevice enthusiast’s dream.""  – AppVersity Review

************************************************************
Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter is a console-quality hunting game which lets players explore huge non-linear locations as they attempt to track down a variety of dinosaurs that are armed with some of the most advanced AI on the platform.  As a result, these are no “pea-brained” dinosaurs – these are dangerous creatures that are able to see, hear and sense the hunter.  If you’re not careful, it’s very easy for the hunter to become the hunted.

With 15 different dinosaurs across 5 distinct environments including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills, how you approach your target is important.  Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey. 

Game Features:
• 3D dinosaurs, from the Herbivorous (plant eating) for novice hunters to the Carnivorous (meat-eating) for experts;
• Choose from among six different weapon types – from a sniper rifle to an X-bow;
• Utilize the map and radar feature to locate and track dinosaurs;
• 2 exciting game modes:
- Hunting: a non-linear hunting experience where players roam through vast landscapes, tracking and hunting a variety of dinosaurs;
- Survival: a timed, frenzied affair where dinosaurs begin rushing the player in an attempt to eat him.  The pace starts slowly and builds, and the person who can stay alive the longest is the winner;
• Online leader boards and social networking integration;
• Interactive Dino Trophy Room.

Coming with updates:
- Ability to jump
- Blood
- Ammo supply
- Statistics and more...

Comprehensively updated and enhanced, the 2010 version represents the most complete, realistic and addictive version to date.  

The return of X2 Soccer’s genre defining floating analogue controls, the launch of the all new Dream Team mode, the addition of over 150 club teams, 10 national leagues, additional commentary, improved visuals and online multiplayer have combined to create the ultimate iPod touch and iPhone Soccer experience for the summer and beyond.  

In addition to this year’s host of improvements and added extras is the introduction of the all new Dream Team mode, where players must use all of their Soccering knowledge to create their very own ‘Dream Team’. Gamers start out with an initial team, poor in overall ability; they then compete in multiplayer, tournament and quick match modes for tokens. Which can then be used to scout and recruit quality players from across the globe, to help create the ultimate Dream Team. 

X2 Soccer 2010, the best just got better…

• Play More: With over 150 club teams, 30 competitions and the all new “Dream Team” mode.
• Play Faster: With refined controls, improved visuals and 3GS optimization.
• Play Smarter: Against enhanced defensive and attacking player AI. 
• Play Anywhere: Connect with friend or foe over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or online!

X2 Soccer’s exclusive soundtrack is provided by Trouble Over Tokyo. All four instrumentals included are taken from the bands forthcoming album ‘the Hurricane’ which is due for release later this year.

X2 Snowboarding is a fast-paced extreme sports simulation, combining console quality graphics & physics with arcade style game play. Players compete in a series of freestyle, race & trick-race events across an international stage.

•Fluid motion and touch controls 
•Optimal graphics & unique visual style 
•Bluetooth & local WiFi multiplayer 
•Full motion-captured player animations
•In-game rewind: re-wind and re-play during your run to retry missed opportunities
•Adrenaline: slow down time and enhance your handling and trick performance capabilities
•Replay save system
•Tru Thoughts Recordings licensed soundtrack: featuring Quantic, Bonobo & Mr Scruff
•Official Salomon in-game boards unlocked as you progress

*****************************************

After learning the basics and earning your boarding pass from the Boarding School, take the character of your choice to the varied international slopes. Choose from 6 colourful boarders; Adler (Germany), Yukiko (Japan), Edward (UK), Katie (Canada), Aaron (America) & Terhi (Finland), each with individual strengths and weaknesses suiting  particular playing styles and event types.  Your boarder will be taken from the commercial slopes of USA, to going off the beaten track under the setting sun of Japan, to taking illicit advantage of the ski-only slopes in Switzerland, the perilous back country traverse of Chile, the night-life of a snow-village resort in Canada and the final treacherous cliff edge teeter in New Zealand.

The boarding is performed with an intuitive combination of iPhone accelerometer tilt & on-screen touch/gesture control- with 2 varying tweaked control mechanisms to choose from.
Once you’ve got the hang of the controls, you’ll soon realise that X2 Snowboarding is no ordinary snowboarding game! Successfully performing and chaining spins, flips, grabs, grind manoeuvres & buttering bestows your boarder with time-warping abilities to rewind & replay sections of the course in real-time, release adrenaline to slow down time to perfect tricky manoeuvres or ‘boost’ to leave your opponents standing. Using these special abilities wisely will give your boarder the edge in competition.

For a different challenge, take on your friends in multiplayer events over a Bluetooth or Wi-fi connection. In our first update (coming soon), online multiplayer will become available allowing for infinite competition once you’ve excelled your friends and our AI.

The first, which is fully real time, offers spectacular gameplay with intense battles between blocking linemen and daring displays of agility of players leaping and dodging through opponents tackle zones, while powerful spells and dirty trick special plays are unleashed across the field. All this creates a highly charged atmosphere. Of course, since it is sometimes difficult to keep an eye on the entire field at once, the game's interface offers different tactical and strategic setups, while the AI is responsible for managing the players on the field. The second game mode, an actual turn-based game, is a treat for players of the original board game because it is an exact replica of Games Workshop's tabletop masterpiece.

The creators of the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise bring you into the next-generation of fighting, engineered for the PlayStation4. Step into the Octagon with EA SPORTS UFC and make your opponent feel every strike, takedown and submission.

Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, EA SPORTS UFC brings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible.

UNPRECEDENTED FIGHTER LIKENESS
EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. Every single licensed fighter in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.

MMAI
A mixed martial artists mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fights.

FULL BODY DEFORMATION
Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to Fight Night changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighters flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression

REAL-TIME EXERTION
A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.

PRECISION MOVEMENT
MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.

STRATEGIC SUBMISSION BATTLES
To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat. EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.

REAL DAMAGE
Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day. EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.

DYNAMIC STRIKING
A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too.

GAMEPLAY
Reimagined gameplay creates fundamental advances that you’ll feel across every mode in FIFA 22. A goalkeeper rewrite brings more composure and consistency to the most important position on the pitch, new ball physics reimagine every pass, shot, and goal, and explosive sprint lets you feel the acceleration of the game’s quickest players.
•	Goalkeeper Rewrite - A brand new goalkeeper system brings a new level of intelligence to the last line of defence, unlocking more reliable shot-stopping and smarter decision-making between the posts. In FIFA 22, goalkeeper positioning personality replicates the different styles of keepers throughout the game - from the lightning-fast reflexes of world-class shot stoppers like Jan Oblak to the aggression of sweeper keepers such as Ederson.
•	True Ball Physics - Real-world data imported into FIFA 22 takes the game’s ball physics to a new level of realism. Tuned parameters including speed, swerve, air drag, air resistance, ground friction, and rolling friction mean every touch, trap, shot, volley, pass, and dribble will look, move, and fly like the real thing.
•	Explosive Sprint - A new gameplay mechanic that changes the dynamic of one-on-one situations, Explosive Sprint gives you more control over acceleration when dribbling or defending. Lure opponents in and choose when to unleash your full speed to get away from the defender as you drive your team forward in attack.",73,1.8,Sports
