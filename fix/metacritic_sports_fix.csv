In Mikado Defenders players deploy samurai foot soldiers, archers, and other units, desperately attempting to defend their fortress from an all-out demonic attack. It’s tower defense, with a uniquely Japanese twist! 

Set in the Sengoku Era—a time when Japan was torn asunder by civil war—

Mikado Defenders features historical locations such as Edo and Osaka, renowned samurai commanders including Uesugi Kenshin and the “One-Eyed Dragon” Masamune, powerful Guardian Spirit allies, giant demonic enemies, an in-depth castle improvement system and more!


Special Characteristics:


- Castle Improvement – 

Build your base up from a humble campsite to an impregnable fortress, complete with barricades and turrets! Investing in your castle is vital if you’re to have any hope fending off the Skull Wheel and other massive demons! 

- Guardian Spirits – 

Hold off the attacking demons for long enough and your castle will attract the aid of mystical allies. A single attack from one of these Guardian Spirits boasts the power to turn the tide of battle! Guardian Spirits also improve with your fortress; the stouter your defenses, the more powerful your ally!

- Samurai Commanders – 

Reinforcing your castle and successfully destroying a “boss” giant demon has the chance of drawing a new samurai commander to your side! Recruit Oda Nobunaga, Sanada Yukimura, Date Masamune, and more! Each commander has their own special characteristics, and these abilities will prove vital in staging a successful defense!

- Class Change System -

Each unit will be promoted to an elite class by increasing its level to certain point!

-Taste of The Traditional Japan Art - 

Not only the in-depth tower defense game system, Mikado Defenders features the Japan Art taste throughout the game, inspired from such art style as “ukiyo-e” paintings, and “sumi-e” paintings.


Other Features:


- Simple yet strategic game play!
- Intuitive goals: place your troops on the map, fend off attacking demons, and guard your castle!
- Easy controls: deploy samurai, select commanders, and unleash powerful guardian spirit attacks through intuitive taps and flicks!
- Play on your terms: you can suspend games mid-level, and come back to them later, picking up right where you left off!

The price will be raised to $9.99/€7,99/£5.99 when the free universal iPad update with extra high-res textures and special controls launches in only a few weeks. Additional localizations in French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian and Chinese will be added too.

Finally, after more than a year in development, the next installment of the epic space shooter Galaxy on Fire™, described in the gaming press as the ""Ambassador of the iPhone"" and featured by Apple as one of the best 100 games in 2009, is available for the iPhone. Galaxy on Fire 2™ sets new standards and offers unprecedented quality and game depth for the sci-fi genre: discover a galaxy with more than 20 solar systems and 100 different 3D space stations. The epic story featurs full voice acting, dramatically portrays the battle for survival of the Terrans, Midorians, Nivellians and Vossks and provides over 10 hours of exciting space adventure. Together with a countless number of freelance missions, over 30 space ships that can be fully customized and a complex trading simulation, Galaxy on Fire 2™ is the ultimate sci-fi benchmark in the App Store.

The mercenary Keith T. Maxwell, the hero of the first part, is catapulted through space and time because of a malfunction in the hyperdrive of his space ship. He wakes up 35 years later and finds himself in a very different galaxy. The fragile peace between the four peoples, which has been maintained for generations by the galaxy’s diplomats, is on the line: the Voids, an aggressive alien race, have entered the known universe using wormhole technology. United by a common enemy, the former adversaries now fight side by side for the survival of the galaxy.

Determine the fate of Keith T. Maxwell: follow the main plot, complete various missions as you go, or simply hunt and capture goods from your victims. Sell your loot for maximum profit on one of the many space stations so that you can keep your ship equipped with the best weapons and specialist gear. Land on asteroids and mine for ore which can be used in conjunction with blueprints to manufacture rare equipment or trading goods. Using new special weapons, tactical commands to your wingmen and the option of taking over control of the gun turrets of your ship, you must prove yourself in all kinds of situations, from special secret missions to epic space battles, in order to save the galaxy.

Two players who pretend to be lovers. They pretend to be lovers separated from each other by lightyears of deep space. They have lonely walks along the shore of a simulated ocean, thinking wistful thoughts of each other. Thoughts from ancient Earth literature by Marguerite Duras.

The empty beach, the strong wind, the gentle music and a small colony of electric seagulls are their only companions. Yet their heart is full and their mind confused. Walk along the shore, until they meet the emptiness.

When it all becomes too much, they run towards each other. Enabled by intergalactic networks, they touch each other’s holographic bodies in cyberspace. A surreal game of chess becomes the apparatus through which they, man and woman, can talk. The words they have were given to them, as they have always been to lovers everywhere.

The sea remains, tugging at their hearts when not at their hairs and clothes, as it itself is tugged by the virtual moon. And as great as the desire for the other may be, they cannot stay away from the wind and the waves and the sand. Every time they find a new treasure. An abandoned tennis field. An heap of coal. A dead dog. Ordinary. Absurd. Meaningless. Yet comforting.

Enter a café, exit a villa, enter a casino, exit the ruin of an ancient colonial mansion. We know this is not real. So it doesn’t surprise us. Nothing surprises us. It doesn’t matter when you feel the pain of love. Of being in love, of falling in love, of leaving in love. There is no such thing as time. There is only love. And it never stops. No matter how much it hurts.",62,4.4,Simulation

Now the same Mac & PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back and available on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch!Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to “play it your way”… Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps.

Carmageddon 1 & 2 were “Driving Game of the Year” 1997/1998.SELECTED REVIEWS OF THE ORIGINAL GAMEOriginally released for the PC in 1997, Carmageddon was an instant hit and the titles went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Here’s what a sample of the gaming press thought at the time:“Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun...” - GameSpot 8.8 out of 10 “Carmageddon, to get straight to the point, is one of the best computer games I've ever played… Carmageddon is God!”  - Duncan McDonald 95% Classic Award PC Zone Magazine“Carmageddon is one of those games that only come along once in a blue moon. An essential purchase.” - Escape Magazine 6 out of 6“The gameplay is spot on and anyone with a dark enough sense of humour should give it a go.”  - Computer Gaming World 4 out of 5 “So next time you gun down coppers on GTA VI, just remember, Carmageddon’s controversy was there first, and you have a lot to thank it for.” - RetroGardenABOUT STAINLESS GAMESStainless was founded in 1994 by Patrick Buckland, a veteran of the games industry going back to the Jurassic period of 1982, and Neil Barnden, who used to have hair like a mammoth. A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar.  Stainless Games now employs well over fifty mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England.",74,8.5,Simulation

It’s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance.

Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora, just like in the gif above. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection!

Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most!

The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects.

Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes they need a bit of extra help!",63,tbd,Simulation

The move gives Triple Play another leap in realism, from the ultra-sharp graphics with real player faces and stadiums to the advanced AI that enables more realistic and flexible gameplay. The DUALSHOCK 2 controller's analog features are now a key element of the batting, pitching, and fielding control for a truer sports gaming experience. To get the game right, EA once again turned to the pros--American League MVP Jason Giambi of the Oakland A's and National League Manager of the Year Dusty Baker of the S.F. Giants lent their expertise on how to play hardball in the majors. Of course, in baseball, what it all boils down to is the showdown at the plate--the pitcher facing off against the batter for all the money. Triple Play Baseball again refines the game with a power zone/contact zone batting cursor--power hitters may have a tiny cursor, but it's all power zone, while more dependable sluggers will have a larger cursor but may have a smaller sweet spot. Batters are going to need all that control if they're hoping to tee off the pitching this year, which is also improved in control to give them every trick in the books. Players' skills are accurately based on player stats from last season, so if you see Mark McGwire at the plate or Randy Johnson on the mound, expect some bad things to go down.",74,tbd,Sports

Experience the intensity of a strategic match-up on each possession, outwit your opponent by creating a favorable mismatch, and then make a move that scores the bucket to lift your team and your fans to victory. For the first time, you have complete control over dozens of new offensive post moves, including finesse ones like an up-and-under, drop step, hook spin, jump hook, and pump fake, and the ability to combine moves together. Animations can be interrupted at any time to transition into a new move, enabling you to read and respond to the defense, just like real life. Take command of the post on defense with strategic positioning to dominate down low -- guard your opponent man-to-man, front him to deny the entry pass or read the offense and go for the steal. NCAA March Madness 08 finally makes dream match-ups a reality, enabling you to replay classic games in college basketball history. Featuring more than 70 classic teams, take the court as the 1972 UCLA Bruins against any of the great North Carolina Tar Heels teams of the 1980s, the Duke Blue Devils of the 1990s or the two-time defending national champion University of Florida Gators.

Millennia have since passed, and the temples now lie in ruins. But their energy still resonates from the land, attracting adventurers from distant lands. Drawn by the unknown force, friends have begun to rebuild the ruins into ball courts, knowing only that they must relive the time-honored test of the spirit of the Elders: the game now known as basketball. HoopWorld is a three-on-three basketball game with an arcade twist. Unique characters and beautiful natural locations set the stage, while fighting and random power-ups keep the game fast and rough. Choose your favorite team and basketbrawl across the globe to become the undisputed world champions.

""Overall Carnivores is unbelievably deep and features unlimited replay value. Every hunt is different, there’s tons of strategy involved and it’s really an iDevice enthusiast’s dream.""  – AppVersity Review

************************************************************
Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter is a console-quality hunting game which lets players explore huge non-linear locations as they attempt to track down a variety of dinosaurs that are armed with some of the most advanced AI on the platform.  As a result, these are no “pea-brained” dinosaurs – these are dangerous creatures that are able to see, hear and sense the hunter.  If you’re not careful, it’s very easy for the hunter to become the hunted.

With 15 different dinosaurs across 5 distinct environments including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills, how you approach your target is important.  Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey. 

Game Features:
• 3D dinosaurs, from the Herbivorous (plant eating) for novice hunters to the Carnivorous (meat-eating) for experts;
• Choose from among six different weapon types – from a sniper rifle to an X-bow;
• Utilize the map and radar feature to locate and track dinosaurs;
• 2 exciting game modes:
- Hunting: a non-linear hunting experience where players roam through vast landscapes, tracking and hunting a variety of dinosaurs;
- Survival: a timed, frenzied affair where dinosaurs begin rushing the player in an attempt to eat him.  The pace starts slowly and builds, and the person who can stay alive the longest is the winner;
• Online leader boards and social networking integration;
• Interactive Dino Trophy Room.

Coming with updates:
- Ability to jump
- Blood
- Ammo supply
- Statistics and more...

Comprehensively updated and enhanced, the 2010 version represents the most complete, realistic and addictive version to date.  

The return of X2 Soccer’s genre defining floating analogue controls, the launch of the all new Dream Team mode, the addition of over 150 club teams, 10 national leagues, additional commentary, improved visuals and online multiplayer have combined to create the ultimate iPod touch and iPhone Soccer experience for the summer and beyond.  

In addition to this year’s host of improvements and added extras is the introduction of the all new Dream Team mode, where players must use all of their Soccering knowledge to create their very own ‘Dream Team’. Gamers start out with an initial team, poor in overall ability; they then compete in multiplayer, tournament and quick match modes for tokens. Which can then be used to scout and recruit quality players from across the globe, to help create the ultimate Dream Team. 

X2 Soccer 2010, the best just got better…

• Play More: With over 150 club teams, 30 competitions and the all new “Dream Team” mode.
• Play Faster: With refined controls, improved visuals and 3GS optimization.
• Play Smarter: Against enhanced defensive and attacking player AI. 
• Play Anywhere: Connect with friend or foe over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or online!

X2 Soccer’s exclusive soundtrack is provided by Trouble Over Tokyo. All four instrumentals included are taken from the bands forthcoming album ‘the Hurricane’ which is due for release later this year.

X2 Snowboarding is a fast-paced extreme sports simulation, combining console quality graphics & physics with arcade style game play. Players compete in a series of freestyle, race & trick-race events across an international stage.

•Fluid motion and touch controls 
•Optimal graphics & unique visual style 
•Bluetooth & local WiFi multiplayer 
•Full motion-captured player animations
•In-game rewind: re-wind and re-play during your run to retry missed opportunities
•Adrenaline: slow down time and enhance your handling and trick performance capabilities
•Replay save system
•Tru Thoughts Recordings licensed soundtrack: featuring Quantic, Bonobo & Mr Scruff
•Official Salomon in-game boards unlocked as you progress

*****************************************

After learning the basics and earning your boarding pass from the Boarding School, take the character of your choice to the varied international slopes. Choose from 6 colourful boarders; Adler (Germany), Yukiko (Japan), Edward (UK), Katie (Canada), Aaron (America) & Terhi (Finland), each with individual strengths and weaknesses suiting  particular playing styles and event types.  Your boarder will be taken from the commercial slopes of USA, to going off the beaten track under the setting sun of Japan, to taking illicit advantage of the ski-only slopes in Switzerland, the perilous back country traverse of Chile, the night-life of a snow-village resort in Canada and the final treacherous cliff edge teeter in New Zealand.

The boarding is performed with an intuitive combination of iPhone accelerometer tilt & on-screen touch/gesture control- with 2 varying tweaked control mechanisms to choose from.
Once you’ve got the hang of the controls, you’ll soon realise that X2 Snowboarding is no ordinary snowboarding game! Successfully performing and chaining spins, flips, grabs, grind manoeuvres & buttering bestows your boarder with time-warping abilities to rewind & replay sections of the course in real-time, release adrenaline to slow down time to perfect tricky manoeuvres or ‘boost’ to leave your opponents standing. Using these special abilities wisely will give your boarder the edge in competition.

For a different challenge, take on your friends in multiplayer events over a Bluetooth or Wi-fi connection. In our first update (coming soon), online multiplayer will become available allowing for infinite competition once you’ve excelled your friends and our AI.

The creators of the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise bring you into the next-generation of fighting, engineered for the PlayStation4. Step into the Octagon with EA SPORTS UFC and make your opponent feel every strike, takedown and submission.

Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, EA SPORTS UFC brings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible.

UNPRECEDENTED FIGHTER LIKENESS
EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. Every single licensed fighter in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.

MMAI
A mixed martial artists mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fights.

FULL BODY DEFORMATION
Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to Fight Night changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighters flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression

REAL-TIME EXERTION
A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.

PRECISION MOVEMENT
MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.

STRATEGIC SUBMISSION BATTLES
To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat. EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.

REAL DAMAGE
Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day. EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.

DYNAMIC STRIKING
A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.",72,tbd,Sports

Unleash your inner fighter in this unbelievable sporting event. Fight via simple motion and button controls  Grab onto your Joy-Con with a unique ""thumbs-up"" grip and use simple motions and button presses to outthink your opponent.

*    Select from a variety of fighters  Select from brand-new fighting superstars like Ribbon Girl, Master Mummy, and more! Each fighter has their own special attributes to learn and master.
*    Fight in arenas with unique obstacles  Throw punches around (or through) mysterious liquid-filled columns in a spooky laboratory, or in certain arenas, toss fighters onto trampolines for epic aerial skirmishes.
*    Choose your arms carefully  Each weapon has its own strength. Some are slow and do tons of damage, while others are fast as lighting, but will only serve to set up larger combinations. It's up to you to mix and match your arms to fit your play style.",77,7.1,Sports

A goalkeeper rewrite brings more composure and consistency to the most important position on the pitch, new ball physics reimagine every pass, shot, and goal, and explosive sprint lets you feel the acceleration of the game’s quickest players.
•	Goalkeeper Rewrite - A brand new goalkeeper system brings a new level of intelligence to the last line of defence, unlocking more reliable shot-stopping and smarter decision-making between the posts. In FIFA 22, goalkeeper positioning personality replicates the different styles of keepers throughout the game - from the lightning-fast reflexes of world-class shot stoppers like Jan Oblak to the aggression of sweeper keepers such as Ederson.
•	True Ball Physics - Real-world data imported into FIFA 22 takes the game’s ball physics to a new level of realism. Tuned parameters including speed, swerve, air drag, air resistance, ground friction, and rolling friction mean every touch, trap, shot, volley, pass, and dribble will look, move, and fly like the real thing.
•	Explosive Sprint - A new gameplay mechanic that changes the dynamic of one-on-one situations, Explosive Sprint gives you more control over acceleration when dribbling or defending.
