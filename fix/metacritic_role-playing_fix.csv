At the heart of the island towered an ancient, enormous tree that stretched up to the very heavens. For ages past, chaos and sorrow had engulfed the world until at last its salvation appeared in the form of a boy, a girl, and a holy sword. Time flowed on and peace returned. The sword and the tree remained, and they soon came to be known as the Sword of Mana and the Mana Tree. Followers of the Mana Tree returned to Illusia as the world started slowly but surely down the path to recovery. The eight elemental spirits are a staple of the Mana series. These powerful allies aid you with healing and special status effects. They can also unleash fearsome magic upon your foes. The greatest innovation of this installment of the Mana series is allowing four players to advance the story and solve quests together while maintaining the feel of an action RPG.

Archadia's invasion and the subsequent death of the Dalmascan king prompted the Princess Ashe, the sole surviving heir to the Dalmascan throne, to take up arms against the invaders. In her struggle to oust the occupying Archadian forces and restore freedom to her people, Ashe must watch as many of her allies pay the blood price for that freedom. Though tempted to abandon all hope in the face of the Empire's might, her determination keeps her from succumbing before what would seem to be inevitable defeat. Then she meets Vaan, an urchin from the Dalmascan capital of Rabanastre. Vaan dreams of one day becoming a sky pirate, escaping the Empire on his airship. Vaan, Ashe, Vaan's friend Penelo, the sky pirate Balthier, his partner Fran and many more are on an adventure through Ivalice that traces the mysteries behind the Archadian Empire's invasion. Bringing with it a wide array of new gameplay elements, Final Fantasy XII will change the way players think about the Final Fantasy series. Numerous possibilities abound within each scenario, allowing for a less linear, more unique experience for each player.

Leading this army is The Apocalypse Dragon, a seemingly unstoppable five headed juggernaut of destruction that has been reborn and set loose on an unprepared populace.  Taking the role of one of 5 characters, the player must band together with other legendary heroes to face this Dragon and defeat the forces of Chaos in the ""Mage Knight"" universe. Team dynamics are vital in Mage Knight Apocalypse, and players need to select their party carefully, combining melee, ranged and magical strikes in conjunction with overwhelming group combo attacks to triumph in battle. Players can quest alone or with friends in five-player cooperative and competitive play modes, working together or going head-to-head in the ultimate clash for battlefield supremacy.  Players can choose from five distinct character classes and customize them with hundreds of weapons, armor and items, equipping the right gear for each intense encounter.  Unlike other action RPGs, in Mage Knight Apocalypse, players have no need to worry about ability points or discreet levels to gain.  Instead, character development depends on what type of playing style the player enjoys.  Swinging a heavy sword makes you stronger, casting spells makes your magic more powerful, and shooting bows improve dexterity.  The skills players use and the way they use them determines how the character develops. [Namco]",47,5.4,Role-Playing

The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria’s consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should have been sealed has awakened—a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that ""sealstones"" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights.

In an intertwining chapter-driven story, the player takes turns controlling one of three gritty characters that, for their own reason, have ""volunteered"" to get to the bottom of the mystery behind the controlling crime syndicate's power. The player's characters becomes more powerful as they claw their way up the echelons of the underworld and as their individual stories begin to overlap. As the player's influence on the city grows, the businesses, the payoffs and the number of confrontations with rival gangs enables the player to gain experience and become powerful enough to take control of the city piece by piece. After becoming a underworld force to be reckoned with, the player discovers that the gang wars have been masterminded by a secret society, at the head of which are a coterie of terrifyingly dangerous and powerful figures that, it seems, no bullet will stop.

Players take the role of Seth Walker, a cybernetics engineer suddenly thrust into a struggle to save humanity from extermination. As the adventure progresses Seth is offered opportunities to sacrifice pieces of his humanity for cybernetic upgrades that will assist him in his mission to preserve the human race. But what price will he pay to save his own humanity? Only the player can decide Seth’s ultimate fate. Incorporating innovative cybernetic augmentations into its storyline, Space Siege explores the dilemmas faced while keeping one's humanity in the face of adversity. Cybernetic augmentations can be performed on every part of Seth’s body. On the extreme end, players are able to outfit Seth with cybernetic upgrades that leave little or none of his original humanity intact. But this choice comes with the risk of alienating Seth from the people he's trying to save. Players can also insist on preserving Seth’s humanity by not using upgrades, instead forging ahead clearing the Armstrong of its alien invaders with natural human ingenuity and strength. Such a decision increases the difficulty of completing his mission of uncovering and eliminating the alien menace that’s bent on destroying the human race. [Sega]",60,6.2,Role-Playing

? TouchArcade.com Says:

In its 1996 anniversary issue, Computer Gaming World listed the game as #147 in the ""Top 150 Best Video Games of All Time."" It has been inspiration for many dungeon crawlers created since...

The iPhone version, with which I've spent notable time this weekend, features completely redone graphics utilizing OpenGL ES to add depth to the stony visuals. It allows for pinch-and-spread zoom control to focus on the action at hand and features an optional on-screen mini map to aid in negotiating the twists and turns of each dungeon level. What's more, Paul has implemented a full, real-time music synthesizer system for the game which delivers sound that, while ringing of retro, surpasses the quality of the C64's SID-based score.

But, really, what makes the game so well suited for the iPhone is its casual nature as compared to the typical roguelike. And that's not to say the game is shallow or light on dungeon crawling action, but rather I feel it's simply a bit more accessible to the typical gamer than, say, Nethack, Moria, or Rogue thanks to an economy of controls, spells, and the like.

? iPhone-Gamer.net Says:

Fargoal has been beautifully polished in the visuals department without getting too far from the original game's quirky charm and retro stylings ... It's playable and addictive, perfect fodder for the iPhone / iPod Touch, and certainly one of the best mini-adventures you can get.

Players are immersed in the world of the Lanzheim Continent, a conflict-ridden land deeply divided by a fierce civil war. Powered by the Unreal Engine3 and featuring character designs by famed Korean artist Hyung-Tae Kim, the game bears a striking visual style unlike any other RPG through its blend of photo-realism and Japanese manga influences. The deeply emotional story is driven by beautifully rendered CGI cut-scenes featuring fully voiced dialogue to draw players into the immersive experience. Delivering more than 40 hours of gameplay, Magnacarta 2 features a unique battle system which combines strategic turn-based battles and real-time gameplay, creating a fresh twist on the traditional RPG formula. The game seamlessly blends world navigation and battles as everything happens in the same environment with no load screens or abrupt changes in the action when a fight begins or ends. Players can utilize objects found in the environment to their advantage and likewise, creatures and field objects dynamically react to the player’s actions. A free roaming camera further adds to the unrestricted interaction with the world. Players are also given flexible control over their party with the ability to pre-assign attributes for each AI character and freedom to easily switch control between all the characters at any time. Magnacarta 2 features a variety of adaptable options to keep the action fresh throughout the game. By defeating monsters, players obtain Kamonds which can be used to enhance a variety of weapons as well as create new items. When players change their weapon, they take on a different fighting style that adapts all the related moves and skills to that weapon’s attributes. While normal skills can be performed by any player at any time, special moves require skillfully timed actions to exploit the rhythm of the battle to their advantage. The pinnacle of special moves is the over-drive mode where players can use the most powerful combination of skills at one time to perform devastating attacks to defeat enemies. KAN (magic), representing the four elements of nature (Wind, Water, Lightning and Fire), adds another dimension to gameplay whereby players generate KAN for use in battle and to affect environmental objects in various ways.

After the destruction of the Altar, a powerful magical surge sent a shockwave of unrelenting energy throughout the Empire of the Eight Demons, covering it wholly in a thick layer of ice and plunging it into a time of utter darkness. The world ended. To this day scholars still argue about the exact time but at least five centuries later the surviving humans and daevi awoke to find themselves in an existence that had changed forever. Their once bright heavens and beautiful skies had turned into a thick layer of rock. Outside of it a swirling maelstrom of burning magical energy engulfed all the remnants of a storm of dead spells. Set within a dark post-apocalyptic fantasy world, you will assume the role of a hero bound to find the secrets that lie hidden in the past, present and future. Within hollow rock-realms known as Shards, floating in the confines of the magical Deadspell Storm, a civilization consisting of humans and daevi struggles to rediscover the pieces of their shattered world. This civilization is known as the Enclave of the Five Sacrifices. Although most of the Shards are known to the Enclave, myths and legends tell of many strange and wonderful Shards but these are almost certainly derived from the stories of those that struggled to survive the aftermath of the destruction of the Ancestor World.

A battle mage was dispatched to put an end to this young ""Solomon Dark"" before he could grow in power...

* * *

In Solomon's Boneyard, you can play as one of seven young wizards, with over thirty skills to master.  The game is a survival two-thumb shooter, where you will face wave after wave of undead hordes, while gaining levels and choosing new skills to fight with.

The game comes complete with a high score list, and an innovative perks system that will allow you to grow in power the more you play.

* * *

For veterans of Solomon's Keep, the game can be described as ""endless survival-horror Solomon's Keep.""  While you will not progress through a dungeon, you will level up, and gain new and more powerful skills and items while you fight hordes of undead in the boneyard.

Solomon's Boneyard differs from Solomon's Keep in these ways:

1. Your mana recovers faster.  You start out as a member of the college's junior faculty, boasting more skills than the new graduage in Solomon's Keep.

2. A new primary and secondary skill set is available, utilizing cold magic.  

3. All the skill welding is available, but you'll need to unlock the bonus characters to get to them.  Characters in Solomon's Boneyard cannot get new primary skills, and are stuck with the ones they start with.

4. Gold is persistent.  Any gold you win in a game sticks around forever, for you to buy perks.

5. The perks system allows you to start your game with your favorite skills, or other bonuses.

6. You can find powerup bonuses to increase your damage or level up a skill.

USER SAYS

"" I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS GAME......like seriously, I'm lovin' it (McDonalds might get mad xP). When I first saw the screenshots on TA I thought it was another match-3 game...boy was I wrong, and in a way that absolutely blew my mind. First, I love the graphics and in-game visuals. The character portraits are very well-drawn, kudos to your fabulous visual design team. The core gameplay itself is simple to grasp when playing for the first time but extremely difficult to master, which is a great thing. You have included many additional components such as a variety in unit type and class, as well as the soul cards which add another level of depth to the overall game. All in all, an outstanding SRPG in a very pretty package. ""

No doubt you’ve been waiting years for a half-decent game to show up in the Adventure category of the App Store. Well, this is it. Half-decent, as promised.

EPISODE 1: WE NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS
When a hostage crisis erupts in the centre of Clappers Wreake, only one man has the diplomatic finesse to defuse a simmering situation before it boils over into a stew of butchery and bloodshed: Detective Inspector Hector. He’s all they’ve got. Literally. All the other negotiators are dead. Hector has a choice to make: carry out the terrorist’s curiously altruistic demands, or watch as his fellow officers are picked off one by one. Hector’s still on the fence.

Stagger a drunken mile through the Crime Capital of Britain in the size 9s of Detective Inspector Hector: part criminalist, part kebab-fiend, all cop.

Do all the things you’ve dreamed about: hit a tramp with a crowbar, steal a young man’s trousers, kick a heroin addict into a cardboard box, enter a porn shop without embarrassment, carry a designer handbag... all in the name of justice, and all in spectacular ground-breaking 2D.

Did we mention? It’s not for kids.

This isn’t one of those bog-standard Oh-god-where-am-I-how-did-I-get-here-there’s-a-screwdriver-in-a-desk-drawer type escape games that the interweb seems to be infested with nowadays. HECTOR:BADGE OF CARNAGE takes you back to the glory days of the point 'n click graphic adventure: nonsensical inventory items, favour-hungry reprobates, and a relentless stream of witty one-liners. 

WHAT YOU GET:
 - 18 sordid, filthy, rundown locations
 - 23 well-developed & witty characters (+ 1 stinking drunk)
 - 40 Inventory items (includes Free Lubricant!) 
 - 397 interactive objects
 - 2421 spoken lines of dialogue
 - Cinematic cutscenes
 - Original score
 - A good few hours worth of low action puzzle-solving gameplay

WHAT WE GET:
 - Your cash.

Look, we honestly don’t care if you like it. We just want you to buy it. If you don’t, you’ll never see Episode 2 or 3.

Developed by Dinofarm Games

100 Rogues is an arcade-style dungeon crawling adventure for iPhone, iPod Touch and the iPad. Maps, monsters and loot all generate randomly, making each playthrough a new experience. You won’t find another game that looks, plays, or sounds like 100 Rogues, as it's got fully animated 2D pixel art, and classic videogame-style music.

100 Rogues is about player improvement more than character improvement, as your unfortunate Rogue’s death is almost guaranteed for most players. Like a game of Tetris or Galaga, 100 Rogues isn’t about completion; it’s about seeing how you can do in one play session.

Explore randomly-generated dungeons; find rare magical weapons, armor and other artifacts; meet strange, interesting monsters and do battle in a thought-provoking, turn-based-strategy combat system.  Our characters have their own unique skill trees, and as you gain experience you can unlock new skills to survive against tougher opponents.

- The New York Times

Chaos Rings is the only title I will be playing for quite some time, outside of my normal review requirements.
- 148Apps

The turn-based fighting is gratifying and never got old, and the story and character development remains immersive even in short play sessions.
- Touch Arcade

The iPhone finally has its own triple-A Square Enix RPG that actually reaches the heights of a Final Fantasy or Chrono Trigger.
- Slide to Play

The story, and characters found within Chaos Rings are the most interesting and intriguing I have come across for the iPhone, and perhaps I have to go back to Final Fantasy VII to find it’s equal.

Deep within this foul edifice, the blackest necromancer of modern times, Solomon Dark, sits on his horrible throne.

As a near graduate of the Wizarding College, your final exam is to storm Solomon's Keep.  Dispatch the dark wizard, loot his evil possessions, unbind his horrific minions, and prove to your teachers once and for all that you're not as stupid as you look.

----

In Solomon's Keep, you move your wizard with one thumb, and fire magic spells with the other.  As you destroy enemies, you earn experience points.  Gain enough experience, and you'll gain a level, and can select new skills to help you ascend the tower.

Along the way you'll find gold and magic items.  Your helpful teachers are there to explain the ins and outs of wizarding, sell you a few useful items, and even give you a few tips to improve your skills.

Along the way you'll encounter Solomon's skeletons, zombies, imps, and more. You might even encounter an undead king, and Solomon's meticulously reconstructed maggot vomiting skeletal dragon.  

You'll have a chance to master 21 skills and wield over 50 magic, rare, and epic weapons.

With random dungeons and monsters, Solomon's Keep offers infinite replayability.  It's never the same game twice!

If you're fond of action RPGs, Solomon's Keep will satisfy your black heart.

Cao Cao’s subordinates felt that Guan Yu behaved far too rudely and arrogantly by leaving without bidding farewell and wanted to pursue and bring him back. However, Cao Cao gives Guan Yu a clear passage to travel as he is well aware that none of his generals can defeat him.

Guan Yu begins his journey to reunite with his sworn brother, Liu Bei. Along the 5 passes, he encounters 6 generals. The generals of Cao Cao refuse to clear the way for Guan Yu. Infuriated, Guan Yu kills all of them. However, he soon realizes that Liu Bei was no longer in Yuan’s territory and had left for Runan.

What the Reviewers say:

Aralon is quite simply the best RPG on the App store. 
-NodPad

 ""Aralon possesses more gameplay than perhaps any other iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad game.""
-PocketGamer

""I used to look at my iOS device as a small window into new worlds and fun experiences, and with Aralon I feel like I actually have a fully realized living and breathing universe sitting snugly in my pocket.... I think every iOS gamer needs to pick up this title just to experience what is possible on this constantly expanding mobile platform."" 
- TouchArcade

""Calling Aralon: Sword and Shadow a big game doesn’t quite do it justice. It’s big in the sense that you can fit other iPhone RPGs inside it. It’s big in the sense that it will absorb your free time the way a major console title can. In other words, your desert island iPhone game has arrived. And in case you were wondering, Aralon is great.""

*Hordes of monsters and massive Bosses
Armies of enemies will attempt to tear through your defenses. Only by employing the most effective defensive strategies, teamwork, and strong heroes will you defeat such devilish foes! Many creature types, running the gamut from big Orcs swinging huge axes, to sly Dark Elf Archers striking from the shadows, to crazy Kobolds armed with explosive packs. Unique boss monsters provide set-piece battles and take relentless teamwork to defeat!
 
*Fight your way up through the castle!
Each level has a different setting, layout, enemy types, traps, and distinct scripted surprises. Four difficulty settings from novice to master, which also adjust the rate of experience and types of loot earned. Storybook cinematics tell the tale throughout the Campaign Mode. Survival Mode pits increasing waves of enemies against the players until they fall, with the goal being to defend long enough to achieve the highest Leaderboard score. Challenge Mode allows players to tackle any mission with uniquely altered rule sets and goals!
 
*A Mountain of Stats
Pore over the voluminous report of each session to analyze your team’s performance, review your best stats for each level, and compare your data online with other players to see who is the greatest hero of all.

The game was extremely well received and would spawn a variety of sequels and spin offs.PLOTThe story is set in Tokyo in the year 199X. Demons from the nether-realm of Makai have found their way back to Earth, and as such have upset the balance of power. A charismatic Japanese leader attempts a coup d'état using these demons as a potent military force, forcing America to intervene with its military. The player, as the hero, becomes involved when sent a Devil Summoning Program via email which allows him to converse with and recruit demons to fight for him, storing them as digital data on his computer.In the aftermath of the ensuing destruction, the hero must decide what kind of world should be created on its ruins. Will he side with the angels and create a kingdom of absolute order that would last for a thousand years, or will he side with the demons and bring about an eternal anarchy, or will he choose neither, and destroy everyone who opposes him?GAMEPLAYThe game features two types of characters: Humans and Demons. A key facet of game play involves collecting demons. The human Hero acquires these demons via negotiation, bribing and coercion during battle. Once acquired, they can be stored in the party's portable computer and summoned for a small amount of money to be used in battle, and a constant feed of Magnetite (a secondary currency in the game) to be maintained outside of combat. If a demon is defeated during a battle, they must be revived before they can be used again.A notable aspect of the game is that the player can combine two or three demons and create a more powerful demon.HUMANS:Human characters can equip firearms with special ammo, melee weapons, and multiple pieces of armor from helmet to boots, although certain weapons can only be wielded by a character of a specific alignment. Humans are also the only ones capable of leveling up and having their Stats upgraded at the discretion of the player.DEMONS:There are a wide variety of demons from various mythologies in Shin Megami Tensei; each has its own unique statistics, and a skillset of up to three abilities or spells.!NOTEThis game is not translated and displays Japanese text only.",72,3.9,Role-Playing

A 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat. According to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. Its part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of ""goblinization"", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.

Fast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technologya continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrixa network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporationsmonolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.

And moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners  disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves wont soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to.

The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition.

Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.",81,7.2,Role-Playing

The latest game in the Fossil Fighters series delivers a first: Players can now hop into their vehicles and drive around exotic locations to excavate fossils, which transform into real-life dinosaurs known as Vivosaurs. Players battle their Vivosaur with wild Vivosaurs they encounter on digging adventures.

FEATURES:

*    While driving, set off radar blasts to help discover dinosaur fossils. Different buggies possess different features. A racing buggy, for example, goes fast and allows players to reach faraway places, while a carrier buggy is great for transporting more items.
*    Unearth ancient dinosaur fossils that come to life and transform into Vivosaurs. Clean fossils using tools like hammers and drills on the Nintendo 3DS touch screen, but dont be hasty: Carefully cleaning fossils makes the transformed Vivosaur more effective when it comes time to battle.
*    Using local online play, players can explore and excavate the dig sites as a three-player team.

This was done, so that worthy mortals could appeal to the Jade Emperor and obtain divine powers, to aid in the search of his missing daughter. However, this gift was exploited and taken advantage of, causing chaos in the mortal realm. The Nine Li Tribe became a cult that worshipped demons and practiced in the occult, divorcing themselves from the businesses of the mortal realm.
Forces of evil suddenly arose, inciting wars across the continent, condemning people into a life of fears and sufferings.
Emperor Zhuanxu feared the demon Chiyou would once again ravage the mortal realm. Limited by his own capabilities, he sought the help of the Queen of Huaxu, who once assisted Xuanyuan the Yellow Emperor in warding off the Otherworld with the Bell of Donghuang. Both Fuxi and Nuwathe children of the Queen of Huaxualso supported Emperor Zhuanxu in convincing the Queen, for they too could not bear to watch people suffer any longer. In the end, the gates to heaven were finally sealed with the powers of the Divine Artifacts combined.
Since then, no mortals were able to ascend, nor were gods able to descend at will. This incident was later recorded down in history as Juedi Tiantong.

Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is the work of Lori Ann Cole and Corey Cole, creators of Quest for Glory, Shannara, Castle of Dr. Brain, and Mixed-Up Fairy Tales. Although Hero-U is not a direct sequel to the Quest for Glory games, it features the same mix of adventure, role-playing, humor, and immersive storytelling that we introduced in that series.

Shawn can become the Rogue of the Year while exploring a mysterious castle, making friends and enemies, fighting deadly foes, and uncovering the secrets of his own hidden past. Meanwhile players will enjoy the rich and humorous dialogue and descriptions as they guide Shawn through his adventures.

During the day, Shawn attends classes at the University, practices his skills, and tries to make friends with other students. At night, it's time to pull out weapons, armor, and traps to explore the abandoned wine cellars, stunning sea caves, creepy catacombs, and deadly dungeon beneath Hero-U. Most combat is optional for those who prefer a pure adventure game, but there are ample rewards for those who choose to valorously fight the creatures that threaten the school and all of Sardonia.",80,8.4,Role-Playing

Story:
In Prey: Mooncrash, TranStar's secret moon base stopped transmitting shortly after the events of Prey.

Trapped and under a ruthless contract with KASMA Corp, Peter's only hope of ever seeing his family again is uncovering the moon base's lost secrets.

Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!

Features:

*    Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm! Raise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams.

*    Improve your skills over time. As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions.

*    Become part of the local community. With over 30 unique characters living in Stardew Valley, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person has their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star.

*    Explore a vast, mysterious cave. As you travel deeper underground, you'll encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments, valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and mysteries to be uncovered.

*    Breathe new life into the valley. Since JojaMart opened, the old way of life in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it's former glory by repairing the old community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja Corporation.

*    Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with. There are 10 available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?

Uncover the chilling mysteries of this RPG-investigation game, descending deep into a world of cosmic horrors, creeping madness, and shrouded Old Gods within Lovecraft's iconic universe.

The Cthulhu Mythos has been fascinating audiences for generations, growing to become one of the largest shared universes ever envisioned and giving birth to countless stories, novels, movies, tabletop and videogames since the original publication of H.P. Lovecraft's The Call of Cthulhu. Adaptions and references have formed a widespread legacy stretching back to the very beginning of the 20th century, latching on to the key fear of the human psyche: that of the unknown. Now, Call of Cthulhu will bring the mythos to life like never before, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

In this world, nothing is as it seems. Sanity is an irregular bedfellow, all too often replaced by the whisperings in the dark. Strange creatures, weird science, and shadowy cults dominate the Cthulhu Mythos, intent on realizing their mad schemes to bring about the end of everything. Your mind will suffer -- balancing a razor-thin line between sanity and madness, your senses will be disrupted until you question the reality of everything around you. Trust no one.

Known as Dragon Quest in Japan, the Dragon Warrior series has produced some of the most popular RPGs of all time, and for good reason. Enix caters to their fans with an obsessive attention to detail, creating a universe which is both whimsical and realistic at the same time.

You get to control a young hero (male or female) in the land of Aliahan who is called upon by the king to defeat the Demon Lord Baramos. Your quest will take you through more than 50 caves, dungeons and towns, each filled with monsters to defeat and puzzles to solve. You can stock your traveling party with three companions from nine character classes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.

U.S. gamers got their first taste of Dragon Warrior III in 1992, when the game was released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was massive even for a home console system, and Enix has upped the ante even more with the Game Boy Color version. Revamped graphics make the game look better than ever, new twists to the storyline keep things fresh, and plenty of other changes help to give the adventure a rejuvenated feel.

One of the most intriguing changes is the addition of a personality system. You're asked a series of questions when the game begins, and you are assigned a unique personality depending on your responses. There are over two dozen possible personality traits, and the game changes depending on your character's personality and gender. If you don't like the way you've been labeled, you can always read a book or two to alter your personality.

Monster Medals are another new feature in the Game Boy Color version. Monster Medals are sometimes left behind after you defeat an enemy, and come in three varieties: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Using a Game Boy Game Link Cable, you can trade Monster Medals with your friends to try to complete your collection.

There are over 150 different monsters to strike down throughout the game, including some new monsters like SeaSlime. The bad guys look great, because they were all designed by Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball Z.

Dragon Warrior III is an RPG fan's dream come true -- and it's portable. All hail the Slimes, and have fun overthrowing Lord Baramos.",71,7.1,Role-Playing

This mobile game is a collaboration between The Pokémon Company and DeNA Co., Ltd., and it gives longtime fans an opportunity to reunite with Gym Leaders and Champions from previous Pokémon video games for an all-new adventure. Welcome to Pasio! Pokémon Masters takes place on the artificial island of Pasio. On Pasio, Pokémon and their Trainerscalled sync pairsshare a special bond. Many famous Trainers from every region featured so far in the Pokémon video games have gathered on Pasio along with their partner Pokémon and formed their own sync pairs. You are the main character in Pokémon Masters, and you'll embark on an exciting adventure with a Pokémon partner of your own. Along the way, you'll meet various Trainers, make new friends, and work together with them as you advance through the story. Once you've made friends with other sync pairs, you can form a team that's all your own and aim to become the champion of the Pokémon Masters League tournament being held on Pasio.

Team Up with Famous Trainers

Meeting and working together with formidable Trainers from other regions is a core aspect of Pokémon Masters, and it brings an interesting twist to the game's story. Some of the sync pairs you'll encounter on Pasio include the legendary Pokémon Trainer Red and his Charizard, the powerhouse Trainer (and grandson of the famous Professor Oak) Blue and his Pidgeot, and Cynthia, the Champion of Sinnoh, along with her Garchomp.

Three-on-Three Pokémon Battles

Once you've joined forces with other sync pairs, you'll get to engage in Pokémon battles! The battles in Pokémon Masters are 3-on-3 matches that play out in real time. You can unleash powerful attacks one after the next as your move gauge refills over time. What's more, in Pokémon Masters battles, players can direct Pokémon to unleash attacks as usual, but Trainers can use their own moves and healing items in battle for the very first time. A Trainer's move can increase a Pokémon's stats or have other effects.

Lost in transit while on a colonist ship bound for the furthest edge of the galaxy, you awake decades later only to find yourself in the midst of a deep conspiracy threatening to destroy the Halcyon colony. As you explore the furthest reaches of space and encounter various factions, all vying for power, the character you decide to become will determine how this player-driven story unfolds. In the corporate equation for the colony, you are the unplanned variable.

Key Features:

* The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.
* You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.
* Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.
* Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony's two planets didn't exactly go according to plan.

The veil between life and death is no more.

With a single act of destruction, Sylvanas Windrunner has ripped open the way to the afterlife. Azeroth's staunchest defenders have been dragged into all-consuming darkness. An ancient force of death threatens to break its bonds and unravel reality.

Hidden realms of wonder and horror await any who would pass to the other side. The Shadowlands is home to an entire realm of the departed; it is a world between worlds whose delicate balance preserves life and death itself.

As one of Azeroth's greatest champions, you have been granted the power to cross over in body and soul. Now you must investigate a conspiracy to unmake the cosmos, and help Warcraft legends journey back... or fulfill their ultimate destiny.

New World

What lies beyond the world you know? The Shadowlands, resting place for every mortal soulvirtuous or vilethat has ever lived. Journey through planes of torment and imprisonment to those of rebirth and eternal reward.

Oribos, The Undying City

Oribos is the arrival point for all souls who enter the Shadowlands. At this crossroads, the dead are judged by the impassive Arbiter before being sent to their final destinations, and Oribos' denizens swap gossip and animasoulstuff that serves as both power and currency.

You'll gain access to your Covenant's Sanctum, where you'll accept unique quests, undertake a sprawling covenant campaign, and call upon your allies to embark on important missions. You'll also earn unique abilities based on your Covenant and class, acquire a unique mount and visual appearance, and forge bonds with powerful souls, drawing on their essence to further customize your skills.

Once, the Jailer kept only the most dangerous souls in the cosmos confined in this eternal prison. Now, some of Azeroth's greatest heroes are trapped here, and you'll need to rescue them from the Jailer's tower before he expends their very souls.

Torghast is an endlessly replayable, ever-changing dungeon that you can challenge alone or in a group. Your runs will differ each time, but you'll need to explore cautiously. Death comes at a terrible cost. Defeat enough of Torghast's unpredictable challenges, and you'll be rewarded with unique abilities and items to ensure your present survival or bolster your next run. The further you progress, the greater your likelihood of retrieving materials to craft the legendary weapons and armor that will help you restore balance to the Shadowlands.

Other secrets lie within the tower but they're yet to be revealed.

Leveled-Up Leveling

World of Warcraft: Shadowlands will smooth out the leveling experience and better prepare new adventurers for what's to come. Players will level up to 50 before heading to the Shadowlands (new level cap: 60). 

We've adjusted the experience curve to make it faster than ever to prepare for the newest challenges, and each level along the way will provide more meaningful increases in progress and power. All expansion zones are getting more flexible, too; they'll be able* to scale to you and your friends while you level to 50, so it's easy to try a zone you've never played.

During the day, Shawn attends classes at the University, practices his skills, and tries to make friends with other students. At night, it's time to pull out weapons, armor, and traps to explore the abandoned wine cellars, stunning sea caves, creepy catacombs, and deadly dungeon beneath Hero-U.

Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too wearied by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven
successful.

Noraskov had theorized that the nations of the world were still too wearied by the Great War to enforce the terms of the Treaty. Thus far, his gambit has proven
successful.

The Arkadyan Empire shows no signs of curbing its aggression. It is feared by many that a reprise of the Great War, that at one time could have been prevented, is now all but inevitable. But there are those that believe it can yet be stopped...

The Pokémon Legends: Arceus game honors past Pokémon games' core gameplay while infusing new action and RPG elements. You'll need to catch, survey, and research wild Pokémon in a long-gone era of the Sinnoh region to create and complete the region's first Pokédex. 

-Catch Pokémon-
To catch Pokémon in the Pokémon Legends: Arceus game, you can observe them to learn their behavior, then carefully sneak up, aim your Poké Ball, and let fly!

You can also have your ally Pokémon battle wild Pokémon that you hope to catch. Just throw the Poké Ball holding your ally Pokémon near a wild Pokémon, and you'll seamlessly enter battle and command your Pokémon by choosing from moves it knows.

-An Adventure in the Sinnoh of Days Gone By-
You'll be brought to the Sinnoh region, the setting for the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games. But this story unfolds in a long-gone era, before ideas such as being a Pokémon Trainer or having a Pokémon League even existed.

All around, you'll find Pokémon living wild in harsh environments that make for a Sinnoh unlike the region you may remember from the days of the Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl games.

The Poké Balls of old were apparently built a little differently from the ones we know so well. They were made mostly of wood, and steam puffed from their tops when Pokémon were caught. 

-Meet Your First Partner Pokémon-
As you start off on your adventure to create the region's first Pokédex, you'll be able to choose Rowlet, Cyndaquil, or Oshawott as a partner.

These three Pokémon arrived with a Pokémon Professor, who encountered them on research excursions to various regions. 

Rowlet
Category: Grass Quill Pokémon
Type: Grass/Flying
Height: 1'
Weight: 3.3 lbs.

Rowlet is a Pokémon from the Alola region. It uses photosynthesis to store up energy during the day, while becoming active at night. Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with vicious kicks.

Cyndaquil
Category: Fire Mouse Pokémon 
Type: Fire
Height: 1'8""
Weight: 17.4 lbs.

Cyndaquil is a Pokémon from the Johto region. It is timid and always curls itself up in a ball. When it's surprised, the flames on its back flare up stronger. When it is attacked, it uses its flames to protect itself.

Oshawott
Category: Sea Otter Pokémon
Type: Water
Height: 1'8""
Weight: 13 lbs.

Oshawott is a Pokémon from the Unova region. With the scalchop on its stomach, it blocks opponents' attacks, then retaliates immediately by slashing. Its scalchop can be used to break open hard Berries as well.

Arceus
Holding the key to this tale is the Pokémon known as Arceus. Arceus is said to have shaped all there is in this world. Just how is this mighty Pokémon connected to your journey?

Become Conan or someone else!
All brawns, no brain? No worries! Choose between a diverse cast of badass warrior gods, and add weapons and items to match your style!

Embark on quests of pure epicness!
You are about to save the world! The merchants are still going to charge you for their wares, and some townsfolk may even pester you with tasks of their own. But fear not, some of them will make it worth your while.

Explore in every direction!
Brave the shifting sands of Koth, explore the dark woods in Darkwood, move valiantly through the searing land of Hyperboria and see the icy world of Vanaheim. Conan® Chop Chop lets you explore to the left, right, up and down! A skilled player may even find himself jumping, dashing, or moving diagonally, resulting in the ultimate 3D experience.

Loot, loot and more loot!
Master the fine art of delicately bashing your enemies' heads in with a broom and turning them into chop suey with a bastard sword. Conan® Chop Chop contains a wide variety of different weapons, trinkets and legendary items, each suited to tailor any kind of violent playstyle you can think of.

Master astonishing combos!
Perform the breathtaking 360° spin-attack to crack skulls all around you. Dash forward with the speed of light. Swing your sword both longways and sideways in a game that will have you gasping for air as you struggle to grasp the pure awesomeness of your fighting moves.

Ruthless bosses!
Before facing Thoth-Amon, you must defeat bosses such as The Giant Sand Worm of Koth and The Frost Giant of Vanaheim, neither of which are particularly sympathetic to your cause. Instead they will attempt to destroy you with killer moves like Lava Reflux, Tail Whip and Loogie Glob.

Meg's Monster is a short, story-driven JRPG with a big twist. Players control Roy, who begins the game with 99,999 HP and is virtually untouchable - but the real concern is keeping Meg safe, because if she starts crying, it's game over for everyone. 

Players will have to master the unique mechanics and mini-games baked into each battle, all while protecting Meg and using her favorite toys to keep her pacified.",85,tbd,Role-Playing
