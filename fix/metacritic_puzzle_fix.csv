To get started, you'll line yourself up for a photo - positioning your head and hands as instructed so that your body can become your means to control the madness. You can choose from four game modes to play, each mode featuring five different challenges and hosted by different characters. Whichever mode you opt to play, the fact that it reflects the personality of your host is a guarantee that things will get crazy! In Wario's challenges, you'll have to make big movements with your face and body to succeed - perhaps collecting coins or shaking your head at high speed to dry off a dog! Mona’s mini-games, on the other hand, will require you to line yourself up with targets on the screen. You might have to move your head into place to catch a falling hat or squash a fly just by clapping your hands. In Jimmy’s challenges, you'll play peek-a-boo with a baby, stick fingers up nostrils and dish out a quick massage just by performing the right actions. The remaining set of mini-games are hosted by ninja twins, Kat and Ana. This duo know the value of good friends, which means all their challenges require you to have a sidekick handy.

De Blob is back - and another color Revolution is needed! This time De Blob goes inside the buildings where people are trapped as graydians by the evil INKT Corporation. Find the best possible route through each floor of the building and save as many graydians as possible - or all of them, if you can! For further rewards you can get a bonus for solving the mazes very fast or facing the threat of a bunch of INKT agents chasing you through the building.

There are three game modes and five difficulty levels to give you the control on how much pressure you get when solving the mazes. At the easiest you can take your time to find the perfect solution and at the hardest you have to start moving very quickly to prevent the INKT agents from catching you.

The amount of levels is massive and the level system is open ended – guaranteed to keep the experience fresh and you entertained for hours and hours!

Are you ready for the Revolution?

Next, determine suitable places for the Fallos to land, then fling them to the selected cube with a swinging motion. After that, the Fallos are on their own. If your placement is sound, the Fallos will remain stable and you'll clear the stage after tossing a required number onto the cubes. But if the weight or locations of Fallos causes the cubes to tilt and sway too much, the Fallos will lose their balance and fall off. Adding to the challenge, you'll find that some cubes have different properties, making tosses tricky and further threatening the stability of the Fallos. Guide Fallos through dozens of single-player stages or invite family and friends to join you in two-player cooperative mode. [Nintendo]",79,7.0,Puzzle

From the team that brought you Thumpies –‘game that reinvented the rhythm genre’; here comes one of the most original games this year. Burn the Rope is a unique game for the pyro in all of us. All you have to do is feed the fire! 
 
Burn the Rope is a challenging game where you try to burn as much rope as you can in each level. There’s a catch! The fire only burns upwards, leaving you to tilt and turn your phone to keep your flame alive!
 
As you progress through the levels, you’ll encounter bugs crawling along the rope. Different bugs have different reactions to the flame. For example, the ant changes the color of the flame so you can burn different colored ropes, and the spider shoots out a web bridge so you can access parts of the level that you could not before.
 
Burn the Rope is incredibly fun and addictive. You will actually feel like you’re burning a rope, yet there’s no need for a fire extinguisher! 
Features:
•                      80 exciting levels with more coming soon!

PRAISE FROM THE PRESS
ChuChu Rocket! was a total blast when I had a chance to play it today, and it makes me sad that I never tried out this title almost a decade ago. It seems like a perfect fit for the iPhone, with all of the original levels reworked to be touch screen friendly – touchArcade.com

Gathering up four friends for a manic game of Chu Chu Rocket is a cherished gaming memory. The version of Chu Chu Rocket I was able to play today at SEGA's offices pretty much matched up with those memories – IGN.com

Chu Chu Rocket will command attention by virtue of being different from the steady string match-three puzzlers and its multiplayer push. Even though it can't claim innovation as a port of an older title, there's still a sense of freshness and certainly an appeal about this game of cat and mouse. – PocketGamer.com

MULTIPLE MODES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
As if the 90 distinct levels weren’t enough, Helsing’s Fire also comes with an additional Survival Mode, for the bravest of the brave!

Comprised of only three distinct parts (colored sides, tentacles and life force), the focus of your rotozoan life is simple: grow your tentacles. After playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan. Each mode has its own specific purpose: reach a particular length with your tentacles or grow them to the greatest length possible. In either mode, growing your tentacles means absorbing enemies known as goobugs by touching them. There's just one catch: Successfully absorbing a goobug depends on matching its color to your tentacle. Also, longer tentacles can more easily come in contact with incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force), and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the restorative heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive. With atmospheres ranging from peaceful to intensely challenging, Art Style: Rotozoa offers a wide variety of levels. Victory can only be achieved through quick, precise movement and the ability to remain calm under pressure. Are you ready to take on the goobugs?
