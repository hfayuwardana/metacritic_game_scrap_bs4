In Mikado Defenders players deploy samurai foot soldiers, archers, and other units, desperately attempting to defend their fortress from an all-out demonic attack. It’s tower defense, with a uniquely Japanese twist! 

Set in the Sengoku Era—a time when Japan was torn asunder by civil war—

Mikado Defenders features historical locations such as Edo and Osaka, renowned samurai commanders including Uesugi Kenshin and the “One-Eyed Dragon” Masamune, powerful Guardian Spirit allies, giant demonic enemies, an in-depth castle improvement system and more!


Special Characteristics:


- Castle Improvement – 

Build your base up from a humble campsite to an impregnable fortress, complete with barricades and turrets! Investing in your castle is vital if you’re to have any hope fending off the Skull Wheel and other massive demons! 

- Guardian Spirits – 

Hold off the attacking demons for long enough and your castle will attract the aid of mystical allies. A single attack from one of these Guardian Spirits boasts the power to turn the tide of battle! Guardian Spirits also improve with your fortress; the stouter your defenses, the more powerful your ally!

- Samurai Commanders – 

Reinforcing your castle and successfully destroying a “boss” giant demon has the chance of drawing a new samurai commander to your side! Recruit Oda Nobunaga, Sanada Yukimura, Date Masamune, and more! Each commander has their own special characteristics, and these abilities will prove vital in staging a successful defense!

- Class Change System -

Each unit will be promoted to an elite class by increasing its level to certain point!

-Taste of The Traditional Japan Art - 

Not only the in-depth tower defense game system, Mikado Defenders features the Japan Art taste throughout the game, inspired from such art style as “ukiyo-e” paintings, and “sumi-e” paintings.


Other Features:


- Simple yet strategic game play!
- Intuitive goals: place your troops on the map, fend off attacking demons, and guard your castle!
- Easy controls: deploy samurai, select commanders, and unleash powerful guardian spirit attacks through intuitive taps and flicks!
- Play on your terms: you can suspend games mid-level, and come back to them later, picking up right where you left off!

The price will be raised to $9.99/€7,99/£5.99 when the free universal iPad update with extra high-res textures and special controls launches in only a few weeks. Additional localizations in French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian and Chinese will be added too.

Finally, after more than a year in development, the next installment of the epic space shooter Galaxy on Fire™, described in the gaming press as the ""Ambassador of the iPhone"" and featured by Apple as one of the best 100 games in 2009, is available for the iPhone. Galaxy on Fire 2™ sets new standards and offers unprecedented quality and game depth for the sci-fi genre: discover a galaxy with more than 20 solar systems and 100 different 3D space stations. The epic story featurs full voice acting, dramatically portrays the battle for survival of the Terrans, Midorians, Nivellians and Vossks and provides over 10 hours of exciting space adventure. Together with a countless number of freelance missions, over 30 space ships that can be fully customized and a complex trading simulation, Galaxy on Fire 2™ is the ultimate sci-fi benchmark in the App Store.

The mercenary Keith T. Maxwell, the hero of the first part, is catapulted through space and time because of a malfunction in the hyperdrive of his space ship. He wakes up 35 years later and finds himself in a very different galaxy. The fragile peace between the four peoples, which has been maintained for generations by the galaxy’s diplomats, is on the line: the Voids, an aggressive alien race, have entered the known universe using wormhole technology. United by a common enemy, the former adversaries now fight side by side for the survival of the galaxy.

Determine the fate of Keith T. Maxwell: follow the main plot, complete various missions as you go, or simply hunt and capture goods from your victims. Sell your loot for maximum profit on one of the many space stations so that you can keep your ship equipped with the best weapons and specialist gear. Land on asteroids and mine for ore which can be used in conjunction with blueprints to manufacture rare equipment or trading goods. Using new special weapons, tactical commands to your wingmen and the option of taking over control of the gun turrets of your ship, you must prove yourself in all kinds of situations, from special secret missions to epic space battles, in order to save the galaxy.

Two players who pretend to be lovers. They pretend to be lovers separated from each other by lightyears of deep space. They have lonely walks along the shore of a simulated ocean, thinking wistful thoughts of each other. Thoughts from ancient Earth literature by Marguerite Duras.

The empty beach, the strong wind, the gentle music and a small colony of electric seagulls are their only companions. Yet their heart is full and their mind confused. Walk along the shore, until they meet the emptiness.

When it all becomes too much, they run towards each other. Enabled by intergalactic networks, they touch each other’s holographic bodies in cyberspace. A surreal game of chess becomes the apparatus through which they, man and woman, can talk. The words they have were given to them, as they have always been to lovers everywhere.

The sea remains, tugging at their hearts when not at their hairs and clothes, as it itself is tugged by the virtual moon. And as great as the desire for the other may be, they cannot stay away from the wind and the waves and the sand. Every time they find a new treasure. An abandoned tennis field. An heap of coal. A dead dog. Ordinary. Absurd. Meaningless. Yet comforting.

Enter a café, exit a villa, enter a casino, exit the ruin of an ancient colonial mansion. We know this is not real. So it doesn’t surprise us. Nothing surprises us. It doesn’t matter when you feel the pain of love. Of being in love, of falling in love, of leaving in love. There is no such thing as time. There is only love. And it never stops. No matter how much it hurts.",62,4.4,Simulation

Now the same Mac & PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back and available on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch!Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to “play it your way”… Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps.

Carmageddon 1 & 2 were “Driving Game of the Year” 1997/1998.SELECTED REVIEWS OF THE ORIGINAL GAMEOriginally released for the PC in 1997, Carmageddon was an instant hit and the titles went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Here’s what a sample of the gaming press thought at the time:“Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun...” - GameSpot 8.8 out of 10 “Carmageddon, to get straight to the point, is one of the best computer games I've ever played… Carmageddon is God!”  - Duncan McDonald 95% Classic Award PC Zone Magazine“Carmageddon is one of those games that only come along once in a blue moon. An essential purchase.” - Escape Magazine 6 out of 6“The gameplay is spot on and anyone with a dark enough sense of humour should give it a go.”  - Computer Gaming World 4 out of 5 “So next time you gun down coppers on GTA VI, just remember, Carmageddon’s controversy was there first, and you have a lot to thank it for.” - RetroGardenABOUT STAINLESS GAMESStainless was founded in 1994 by Patrick Buckland, a veteran of the games industry going back to the Jurassic period of 1982, and Neil Barnden, who used to have hair like a mammoth. A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar.  Stainless Games now employs well over fifty mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width. They can all be found dangling precariously from a small chalky rock just off the South Coast of England.",74,8.5,Simulation

It’s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance.

Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora, just like in the gif above. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection!

Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most!

The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects.

Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes they need a bit of extra help!",63,tbd,Simulation
