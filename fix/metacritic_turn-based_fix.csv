Games are started by players sending out Challenges to anybody they know - either exisiting Naked War players in their in-game address book, or real life friends or acquiantences via their email address list.

Each unit is allowed up to seven 'moves' per turn, and can move, attack, enter buildings, drive tanks and other vehicles or use items, etc., each move. Once the player has set up all the moves for their four units, he / she clicks the send button, which sends an email to their opponent containing this turn (in the form of an attached file), then plays back the turn on their PC, showing both players the results of the planned moves. When a player receives a turn in their email Inbox, they simply double click the attachment to launch Naked War, which plays back the turn received then allows the player to set up their own turn in reply. Each soldier in the game starts with a 'doofer', but looses it to their attacker if the damage inflicted is great enough to 'demob' the soldier, losing their uniform and making them naked! The aim of the game is for one team to defeat the other by gaining control of all the doofers, and the winner is declared at the end of the turn where the last doofer changes hands.

Turns can be replied to instantly, during lunchtime, or at the end of the day, or they can wait in your Inbox for days until the you are ready to respond.

Great Little War Game is an action-packed turn-based strategy game in full glorious 3D with a unique and comical graphic style.

Command your army and battle enemies on land, sea and air. Select your units wisely and deploy them to take full advantage of higher ground, natural choke points and defensive walls.

Tactical decisions will be made on every turn. Where should your reinforcements go? Does your base have adequate defences? Do you have time to capture that enemy Factory? Can you afford an aerial strike? Should you make another cup of tea before starting the next round? 

It's a Great Little War out there, and you'd better be ready for it!

Varied missions are the order of the day here - Capture the enemy HQ, Escort the Generalissimo to safety, Guide small squads behind enemy lines, Defend your base... it's going to be one crazy ride!

But fear not - the Great (and definitely NOT cowardly) Generalissimo is here to save the day, along with his indefatigable aide Jenkins. If the Great Little War doesn't get to you, their puns and hi-jinks certainly will.

So tell us, Trooper. Have you got what it takes to win this Great Little War?

********************
“Highborn comfortably sits as one of the best turn-based strategy games we have played on the iPhone.” – TouchArcade.com

“Combines some of the best aspects of the genre's top alumni with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek comedy. 5 out of 5!” – AppSpy.com

“The iPhone hosts plenty of turn-based strategy games, but few with the humor and pop of Highborn.” – IGN.com

“I would recommend Highborn to strategy game experts and those looking to try one out for the first time too.” – TouchReviews.net

********************

Highborn is a casual, turn-based strategy game, perfect for gaming on the go, or for anyone looking for an intelligent, tactical experience without the frenetic play of a traditional real-time strategy game.

Highborn features two types of strategy games in one. Move your army around an overhead map to capture points of interest and receive spells and combat support; then dive into 3D combat to deploy those advantages against an unsuspecting enemy!

All the fun and fighting is set against an irreverent take on the classic good-versus-evil tale. Eight wacky heroes banter about, trading dialogue full of miscommunications and outrageous assumptions.

A LIGHT TOUCH – Enjoy a satisfying strategy experience, no matter if you spend minutes or hours with the game. 

TIME FOR A NEW STRATEGY – A unique blend of strategic movement and 3D combat that caters to a variety of gameplay styles and offers immense replayability.

MULTIPLAY AT YOUR PACE – Think, then act in round-based play against your Facebook friends, and have multiple games going at once. 

MANY STYLES OF PLAY – Unlock hero characters for access to different abilities and play styles, along with different strategies to use against your opponents.  

Highborn is developed by a team of industry veterans, many of who created the original Command & Conquer products, including Rade Stojsavljevic, Adam Isgreen, Joseph B. Hewitt, IV, and Westwood Studios Co-Founder, Brett W. Sperry.

Undo button, multiplayer that does not require Facebook, and more!

Command your army and battle enemies on land, sea and air. Select your units wisely and deploy them to take full advantage of higher ground, natural choke points and defensive walls.

Tactical decisions will be made on every turn. Where should your reinforcements go? Does your base have adequate defences? Do you have time to capture that enemy Factory? Can you afford an aerial strike? Should you make another cup of tea before starting the next round? 

It's a Great Little War out there, and you'd better be ready for it!

Varied missions are the order of the day here - Capture the enemy HQ, Escort the Generalissimo to safety, Guide small squads behind enemy lines, Defend your base... it's going to be one crazy ride!

But fear not - the Great (and definitely NOT cowardly) Generalissimo is here to save the day, along with his indefatigable aide Jenkins. If the Great Little War doesn't get to you, their puns and hi-jinks certainly will.

So tell us, Trooper. Have you got what it takes to win this Great Little War?

So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of ""goblinization"", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.

The blood of those who vowed to protect it and those who sought its power for themselves permeated the battlefields of El Sallia. That sword is known as Langrisser. Of those who swore to protect it, the royal family of Baldea has safeguarded it from the world for many generations. Thanks to Baldea, tales of Langrisser soon faded from memory.
However, Baldea's sworn duty would be called to action once again. Motivated by power and the conviction to rule the world, Kaiser Digos and the Dalsis Empire he commanded invade Baldea, seeking the enticing power of Langrisser. Ledin, the prince of Baldea, narrowly escapes the invasion, and devises a way to avenge his father, who had been killed by Kaiser Digos.
Now, Ledin must reclaim Langrisser, which his ancestors fought so valiantly to protect—thus beginning his journey that will test his loyalty to the Light.

Langrisser II - It has been centuries since the War of the Sacred Sword razed El Sallia. Now, incessant violence plagues the continent. Isolated battles arise all across the land, ravaging towns and nations, before creeping to the next. The Kingdom of Baldea is but a legend, and Langrisser is no more than a fairytale.

In other words, everything moves after you. The game plays out as fast or methodical as you want, featuring a free-flowing turn-based action combat system. Alternating between moving, attacking, using your dash, skills and luring enemies into hazards is the key to success. You are the one that decides the pacing of Evertried. Learn to think ahead. Develop intricate strategies to outmaneuver your opponents and follow your path to ascension!

Test Your Strategic Might
Hitting or defeating enemies in succession increases your Focus Level, which determines the shards you receive and unlocks special powers called Modifiers. The Focus Level goes down when you are idle or just moving, so there is incentive to keep up the action. Luring enemies to traps and getting hit by hazards will also affect the gauge, adding to the strategy.

Outsmart Enemies with Dashes and Skills
Moving strategically and attacking is vital. Close the gap with a Dash -- a mechanic that allows you to move twice the distance and ignore collision, allowing you to transverse an obstacle or gain a better position. Don’t forget Skills and Modifiers-- abilities and passive effects that can be equipped to create your build. Skills improve and carry over into successive runs, whereas Modifiers become stronger based on your Focus Level.

Customize Your Ascent Toward Destiny
The Tower has 50 floors divided into 5 Areas. Each area is unique and introduces new types of enemies. The higher you get in The Tower, the more complex floors will become. Each area has a Shop Floor, where you can spend shards acquired in exchange for health recovery, Skills and Modifiers. Plan accordingly to increase your chance of getting to the top.

Overcome the Guardians, Overcome Your Weaknesses
Each area ends with a Floor Guardian, a boss battle to truly prove your strategic might. Upon losing all your health, the Warrior will dissipate and lose previously acquired powers, reappearing at the First Floor to start ascending again. However, mastery in Skills will carry over into following runs. Rise again Warrior, and face your destiny.",77,tbd,Turn-Based

It's up to you to assemble a team of bold adventurers, and journey through the deserts, explore bunkers, and temples of Northern Africa to discover their hidden treasures and secrets before they fall into the hands of Nazi forces. You and your companions must work together to overcome overwhelming odds - the fate of the world depends on it!

You haven't heard this one before...
Every campaign is generated when it begins, so no two adventures will ever be the same! You never know what's around the next corner - so stay on your toes! Even the most seasoned adventurers can uncover new and exciting discoveries.

Adventures full of mystery
Journey into the unknown and uncover hidden secrets, treasures, characters, and events which have been buried away. There's a wealth of discoveries to be found, and surprises to excite you throughout each adventure!

Learn from your mistakes
In Pathway, defeat isn't necessarily the end of your adventure. Characters will retain their experience after defeat, so players can invest into building a team which will get progressively stronger! There's even rare equipment and advanced skills and abilities to unlock for every adventurer.

Features:

* DYNAMIC ADVENTURES - Discover 5 different campaigns of varying difficulty, with each and every attempt generating a new web of encounters and unique storyline.
* TOUGH CHOICES - Every explored location presents you with one of over 400 hand-crafted story events. Search the well? Save the villagers? It's up to you!
* DECISIVE CONFLICTS - Use cover and positioning in exciting turn-based squad combat. Learn to make the best use of your equipment and your team's abilities, to vanquish a relentless foe, in ruthless and clever ways!
* BUILD YOUR TEAM OF ADVENTURERS - Each of Pathway's 16 unlockable characters has their own skills, weaknesses and quirks, from the almighty melee strength of Brunhilda, to rifle expert daredevil Jackson, and knife-wielding huntress Shani.
* HIDDEN TREASURES - Unearth riches untold, from common weaponry to rare and unique items with special abilities. Perfect your load-out and cash-in on your high-value treasures for a tidy profit.
* THRILLING VISUALS - Classic 16-bit pixel art enhanced with unprecedented depth, lighting and shadows using Pixel/Voxel Hybrid Technology.
* RECOVER & REPLAY - Sometimes failure is the best path to winning. Progressively explore the procedurally generated world, and grow stronger and learn more with each defeat, taking your loot with you even after death.
