This includes the unique 'Team Battle' mode, which doesn't utilize the traditional first, second and third place finishes. Players win the race by depleting their rival's Spirit Points, which are decreased by contact with walls, cars and by falling behind other racers. Divided into 15 areas, two teams compete to dominate the game map through individual races between the different players. By earning points for each victory, players can judge how they stack up against their rivals and cherry-pick their competition from the player roster as they look to seize territories. Win and increase team loyalty, recruit defeated riders and increase your supremacy on the streets while being upgraded in the rankings. But lose, and learn quickly that there are no points for second place in street racing. In addition to Street Supremacy’s stunning racing action, the cars in the game can also be modified to add an edge to the duels. The game's authentically modeled Nissans, Mitsubishis and Subarus can all be enhanced with new exhausts, paint jobs and spoilers. These all prove vital in shaving seconds off the lap times, while stickers and fancy lights can also be used to enhance the car's aesthetics, adding a layer of gloss to an already entertaining racer video game.

**** MODES OF PLAY ****

The game features two play modes:

* Platforming - the player maneuvers the car from roadway to roadway, performing connecting stunts to reach the finish line.
* Time Trails - the player races around stunt-filled circuits to beat the lap records.

Each mode of play is packed full of level content, increasing in difficulty, through 25 Platforming levels and 11 Time Trail levels. There is enough content for long, lasting game play.

**** CONTROLLABILITY ****

The car handling has been designed from the ground up for the accelerometer. The controls are easy, precise and fun. So much so that the player can hug the edge of a corner, using a jet assisted power-slide, and still feel perfectly in control. The car also features mid-air flight controls, allowing the player to nudge the angle of flight and adjust speed with air-braking. It feels very natural to play and we believe it to be the best driving experience on the iPhone to date.

Each race brings something new as you try winning the race by using any of the strategies or switch between them during the race. The key factor in the game is the SCORE. You collect score while racing. Every stunt that you perform will award you with a certain number of score. Hitting objects, driving fast, drifting they all give you a certain number of score. When you reach 1000 you can burn away your score as nitro thus getting an edge over the others. If you are in the lead you can hit more objects thus gather more score. However hitting objects may cause you to make a mistake and crash into something that is immovable. If you can be patient and gather more than 2000 score, your nitro will be even stronger. Another tactic is to select one of the super cars which are fast and have a good traction. In this case you won't gather that much score but most probably you won't need it because you don't need nitro to stay ahead. Another way to win is to gather your score and never burn it since at the end all score points are converted to time and is subtracted from your overall time and you may jump ahead the winner.",59,6.2,Racing

Smash 'N' Survive features several innovations like a physics-based tornado where you can push your enemies or get pushed and ""juiced"" in those destructive tornadoes.
This tornado is only one such environmental weapon which you can use to your advantage. Various maps have catapults, crushers and other objects which you can use to kick trash and annihilate your opponents.
What makes Smash 'N' Survive stand out from the rest is that all the weapons and their behaviours are so unique. Another important point is that it's not a mindless fun jaunt and you can't proceed without planning your attack or without having a strategy in place.
The game features 10 maps ranging from small arenas to big huge levels, giving you an opportunity to try different things. The game features 30+ concept cars and here comes another first these cars are equipped with melee weapons, so no run-of-the-mill rocket launchers or machine guns, but brutal plungers, blades, saws and some geeky weapons like a magneto repulsor. Not all the weapons deal damage and some of them will either throw opponents or topple them, allowing you to plan your attack.
The game offers a campaign mode that has 19 missions, and each mission has primary and secondary objectives. On successful completion of the primary objective, you earn bounty, unlock new cars, unlock new game modes, and unlock new maps and modes for versus mode.
Game modes include territory control, survival, planting a bomb and team deathmatch. Most of the missions revolve around these themes but there are some others like derby, checkpoint race, escorting your mate, killing the convoy, chase, etc. Most of these game modes can be played individually once you unlock them from the campaign.",31,tbd,Racing
