The compelling storyline spans more than 12 new locations, many from Episode III, including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments complete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience, as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia’s blockade runner, the Tantive IV, as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope.

From there, they can dock within the enemy’s capital ship, overtake the ship’s command posts, man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within!

On the island, they are cut off from everything but each other and the inescapable shadows of their own past lives. One by one, the guests share the darkest secrets of their wicked pasts. And one by one, they die... Agatha Christie fans, and newcomers to the genre, can look forward to a series of unexpected turns; although the storyline stays true to the original concept, players will encounter new plot twists. The first comes in the form of an 11th character, the player, a boatman who brings the others to the island and then is trapped there himself. To save the lives of the intended victims, the player must unravel the motives behind the murders and uncover the identity of the killer. If successful, he will spare not only the lives of the remaining guests, but also his own. Using the Wiimote controller, gameplay in this traditional PC adventure game can be taken to a new level of interactivity. For instance, players will have the freedom to control their character's actions, such as using a digging motion to unearth clues, or spinning the handle of a safe using the Wiimote; and the introduction of timed puzzles where, for example, players must race up a set of stairs from a boat docked below.

Join OLIVER, RIGGS and the rest of the BATTLE BEARS on a space odyssey none of them are anywhere close to thrilled to be experiencing. Defend the flagship Ursa Major from an onslaught of confused creatures hewn from the deepest, darkest corners of the cosmos' disturbed imagination. Discover new situations where excessive hugging becomes extremely inappropriate and unwelcome as you traverse the many cells of the Ursa Major (now with REAL bipedal action!) mowing down hordes of Huggables colored brightly in appearance and disposition in extremely amusing and satisfying manners.

Somehow improving on the divine essence that was BATTLE BEARS: ZOMBIES, SkyVu Pictures is proud to present (made possible by the overwhelming support of our first BATTLE BEARS game <3) the prequel of its best selling franchise. 

*Enjoy free range movement as you dodge the excited embraces of the Huggables and swiftly return their attempted sentiments in hot lead.
*Revel in Power Ups from the satisfying to the soul-completing as you end the insignificant existence of each Huggable with extreme prejudice.
*Ride the ""LOL Sled"" down the snowy hill of brand new cut-scenes linking together the compelling story line of the BATTLE BEARS' adventures.
*Cast aside your reliance on your dad's GPS and learn to read a freaking map as you navigate the many action-packed rooms of the Ursa Major.
*Take the fight three feet off the floor with the more difficult RIGGS campaign.
*Fight queasiness and stomach upheaval as you battle against thrilling and mostly disturbing BOSS MONSTERS.
*Plead for sweet rapture as you attempt at least 35 VERY well deserved OpenFeint achievements. 
*Get your hair blown to the back of the auditorium with, honestly, some of the best original music in any App EVER.
*Anticipate some of the best and most exciting updates ever planned within the walls of SkyVu including new campaigns, mid-bosses and weapons (FREE if you've already purchased the game). Seriously, it's time to GET EXCITED.

The Grappler is also a key tool for tactical situations and puzzle solving as players can lift, move, or create cover objects at their whim. The awesome power of gravity is right at players’ fingertips. Additionally, Inversion is one of the first games to feature Havok Destruction which bestows Inversion with massively destructible environments including an elaborate cover system. Set in the near future, the tranquil peace enjoyed by mankind shatters with an unforeseen invasion by an unknown enemy called the Lutadore. Armed to the teeth with futuristic gravity-controlling weapons, the Lutadore easily overrun the city’s defenses. Unbeknownst to all, mysterious anomalies have surfaced in conjunction with the invasion.

Red Faction: Guerrilla still defines the limits of destruction-based game-play with a huge open-world, fast-paced guerrilla-style combat, and true physics-based destruction.

Features:

* Open World Guerrilla Warfare - You decide who, when, where and how to battle. Utilize guerrilla tactics, improvised weaponry, and modified vehicles to lead insurgent attacks on EDF targets. Launch attacks based on your own gameplay style, take on missions in any order you choose, or engage in destructive activities to weaken the EDF's grip on Mars.
* Strategic Destruction - Use destruction to your tactical advantage, setting ambushes or chain reaction explosions to attack enemy strongholds and permanently modify the game environment. Leverage fully-dynamic physics-based destruction to improvise on the fly: blow holes in a wall or floor to set an ambush or escape, take out a staircase to stop your pursuers, or drive vehicles through blown out walls.
* Evolving & Emergent Gameplay - Carve your path through an ever-changing landscape as you improvise your combat tactics - mixing gameplay styles, vehicles, weapons and explosives to defeat the EDF.
* Epic Sci-Fi Setting - Explore the huge, unforgiving Martian landscape, from the desolate mining outpost of Parker to the gleaming EDF capital city of Eos; then tear through the fully destructible open-world environments swarming with EDF forces, Red Faction resistance fighters, and the downtrodden settlers caught in the cross-fire.
* Multiplayer Combat - There is no place to hide when you put your guerrilla warfare skills to the test in a variety of highly destructive multiplayer combat modes.

The Swarm has corrupted the Coalition's robot army and is descending upon human cities. With danger closing in, Kait Diaz breaks away to uncover her connection to the enemy and discovers the true danger to Sera herself.

CHARACTERS: 

Kait Diaz
Kait was born and raised beyond the COG's formal jurisdiction. Her mother, Reyna, was the leader of her isolated Outsider village. Yet Kait also has deep family ties to the COG: her late father was a widely admired lieutenant colonel during the Pendulum Wars and her uncle, Oscar, was a highly decorated frontline Gear in the early years of the Locust War. Even after her induction into the COG, her true loyalties are unknown, even to her.

Kait's Necklace
Kait hasn't told anyone about the Locust necklace her mother gave her before she died and the pressure of this secret is eating her alive.

JD Fenix
The son of Marcus Fenix and Anya Stroud, JD grew up surrounded by stories of his war-hero parents. Unfortunately, an incident at Settlement 2 left JD deeply disillusioned with the COG, after which he and his best friend, Del, went AWOL and joined an Outsider village. After helping to fight back the Swarm's initial push, JD has once again attracted the interest of First Minister Jinn, much to his father's and friends' dismay.

Del Walker
Del lost both his parents in the difficult aftermath of the Locust War and was siphoned into a boarding school, where he met JD Fenix. As a young officer, Del was part of a disastrous mission at the COG's Settlement 2, which shattered his faith in First Minister Jinn's government. Although Del recognizes the need to fight with the COG in the aftermath of the Swarm's emergence, he is not necessarily thrilled to be doing soand he is wholly unprepared to learn details about the Settlement 2 incident that JD has kept from him.

Marcus Fenix
After the Locust War, Marcus played a limited role in the COG, even though his wife, Anya, initially led the government. After Anya's death, it became clear that the COG would favor authoritarian control over civic-minded rebuilding. Now that he and JD have been reunited, Marcus finds himself once again fighting for the COG, but his frustrations with authority, and conflicts with his son, remain ever present.

Last Stop is a single-player third-person adventure set in present day London.  

Written and developed by Variable State, creators of the award-winning Virginia, Last Stop tells three interconnected tales featuring three playable main characters. 

    Donna, a spaced-out high-schooler who feels trapped by her stifling home life and her overprotective big sister. Away from home, Donna seeks teenage thrills with her friends Becky and Vivek, but gets more than she bargained for when the trio become unexpected kidnappers in a game of amateur detective gone wrong. 
    John, an overworked middle-aged single dad. Burdened with debt and the pressures of being an only parent, John jealously pines after the free and easy life of his twenty-something bachelor neighbour, Jack. When the pair unwittingly fall foul of a vengeful stranger, a cursed artefact threatens to transform their lives forever. 
    Meena, a ruthlessly ambitious professional who struggles to find the same satisfaction with her family that she does in the thrill of her work. As Meena vies with an upstart colleague for a crucial promotion, something ancient stirs in the basement beneath her workplace. 

Last Stop is fully voice acted, featuring hours of dialogue and a voice cast of dozens, with performances from some of the brightest talent in the UK today, including rising stars Lulu Simpson as Molly Smith and Kassian Akhtar as Dylan Hughes. 

Last Stop features an original soundtrack by BAFTA award winning composer Lyndon Holland, performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.
