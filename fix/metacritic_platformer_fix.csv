The objective of the source material is to reach the top of each level, taking out any enemies in the way by firing magical rainbows that can trap or eliminate foes as well as providing bridges for the player to walk on. Rainbows remain onscreen for a short amount of time but can be ?broken? by the player if they jump on them. Once broken, the rainbow will fall off the screen, taking out the first enemy it touches. The game also features a pleasing bonus item system where dispatched enemies leave behind items of food that have varying point values and power-ups that have a range of helpful effects. The major feature of this re-interpretation is shifting the entire game away from traditional controls by implementing a global touchscreen control system which radically alters the way in which the game plays. The game is also displayed across both screens of the DS. Rather than being fired by a button press, rainbows are now drawn directly onto the gameplay area using the stylus and movement is executed by dragging the player?s character around the levels. The objective is still to reach the top of the level, but the time limit has been extended to account for the player being unable to move and use rainbows simultaneously.

In a move of desperate irony, Ratchet and Clank steal Tachyon's imperial warship and embark upon an adventure bigger than any they've experienced- one that will not only unravel the mystery of the Lombaxes, but also test the very limits of their friendship.

Set within a complex, hypnotic 3D world, players use the game's unique crush mechanic to ""crush"" the environment and transform it into a more simplified 2D platformer. Once flattened, players utilize the 2D space to move to new areas to solve otherwise impossible challenges, and unlock secret items that were previously unobtainable in the 3D environment. Players then ""uncrush"" the 2D environment and return to the 3D world. Designed for a wide and varied audience, Crush tells the story of Dan, a man with a lifetime of unresolved issues and bottled up emotions that has turned him into a nervous insomniac who is too tired to turn his life around. Desperate for a cure, he turns to hypnosis. It is during this state that he is given one last chance to sort through the wreckage of his past, before he loses the last thing he has – his sanity.

The more sweet moves he does in a row, the more bonus bananas he gets at the end of the stage. To become the king of the jungle, he must team up with animal friends and defeat multiple contenders in boxing matches. [Nintendo]",78,8.5,Platformer

Karoshi has been played by millions on the PC to date to high acclaim.

•Karoshi 2.0 was “internet game of the month” in EDGE magazine

•Karoshi Suicide Salaryman was in WIRED.com’s top 5 PC Games of 2008

•“Some of the most LOL-worth and mind-bending puzzles I have ever seen” TIGsource on Karoshi 2.0

We've been taught we need to survive. We need to reach the end, save the princess and be the hero. That's all well and good, but it's getting boring. Who says it has to be this way? 

Mr Karoshi is an overworked Japanese salaryman who’s had enough and his only goal is to end it all. You control him to work through the fast logic puzzles trying to find hilarious ways to his demise in this highly original, puzzle, platformer with a twist. 

It’s not as easy as it sounds!! You need to think cleverly and sometimes ‘outside the box’ to find a solution. Forget everything you know so far! 

Features: 

* 50 levels  
* Dark Humor
* Collect all the coins
* Karoshi ware mini game
* From the maker of ‘They Need To Be Fed’
* Catchy soundtrack by Jake Almond 

This highly popular, hit, cult game is now available for the first time on iTunes.

The player advances and collects money by defeating enemies and must explore to discover items used to increase abilities, such as magic and transformation. Several years ago, a strange man made his way to the ruins of an abandoned castle on the outskirts of a small town called Verulia. Since then, the townspeople's fear of the castle has grown, and none would dare venture near it. Recently, a merchant traveled to Verulia and discovered the entire town was deserted. Her story was embellished, as disturbing rumors of a vampire inhabiting the castle spread like wildfire through the land. As Latis has become older and learned more about herself from Cereza, she feels she is destined by her heritage, to bring an end to any threat that vampires pose to humanity. After a lengthy discussion with Emarle, who raised Latis since she was a baby and whom Latis considers to be her mother, it’s agreed that she must go with Cereza and travel to Verulia. Latis, travels to the town of Verulia to infiltrate the ancient castle in order to defeat the vampire lord residing there. During her exploration she will obtain powerful items greatly improving her abilities. She will discover and learn how to master her transformation ability and finally through the time spent with Cereza, she will learn her history and the sacrifices made allowing her to become who she is.

In this version the textures of the game are more compressed, so you can see that the game’s graphics are clearer and more detailed than before. You will also see that there is no loading time when you enter or exit a level, which makes the navigation even faster and more enjoyable. Ubisoft has also integrated a new Camera Mode on PS4. By pressing the touchpad of the PS4 joystick, you pause the game and enter this mode, and by moving your fingers on the touchpad, you zoom in and out on the image and drag the image frame; and finally, by pressing the Share button, you can take a photo and share it with everyone. This Camera Mode is a great way to observe in detail all the characters and settings of the game, and a great way of expression to create wacky images with the elements found in the game. On PS4, you can also use the touchpad to scrape the famous Lucky Tickets, then you will really feel like you’re scraping lottery tickets (with the sound of scraping straight from the PS4 joystick).
